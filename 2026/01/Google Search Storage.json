Electric vehicles look like the leading decarbonization solution for road transport. Plummeting costs of batteries have made electric cars (and increasingly trucks) competitive with petrol and diesel ones.\\n\\nIn a previous article, we looked at how biofuel land could be used more efficiently for road transport. We found that the world could electrify all its cars and trucks if we installed solar panels on less than one-third of the land used to grow biofuels.\\n\\nThe outlook for aviation is less clear. Short-haul flights might go electric. Long-haul ones will be more challenging to electrify (although some analysts remain optimistic).1 Hydrogen is one possible alternative to jet fuel, but it is still far from commercial scale.\\n\\nAnother option that gets a lot of attention is biofuels. A small amount of biofuels is already blended into jet fuel supplies in some countries. In 2023, Virgin Atlantic made headlines when it flew the first transatlantic flight powered entirely by biofuels. For many airlines, biofuels are currently the most practical decarbonization option.2\\n\\nBut how much biofuel does aviation actually use today? How much would be needed to replace fossil jet fuel — and could popular sources such as waste cooking oils ever meet that demand?\\n\\nIn this article, we put the key numbers into perspective.\\n\\nBiofuels provide less than 1% of global aviation energy demand\\n\\nTwo statements summarize the current situation with biofuels and aviation today.\\n\\nFirst, only a tiny share of global biofuel production is used for air travel — about 1% of it.3 Most is used for road transport.\\n\\nSecond, biofuels make up only a very small fraction of aviation fuel itself. We estimate around 0.4%.4\\n\\nIn other words, aviation still runs almost entirely on fossil jet fuel.

They are fuels produced from organic matter, generally waste generated by the circular economy (used cooking oils, animal fat, etc.). Biofuels have the advantage of a better carbon footprint\\\\* than traditional fuels. An essential solution to help decarbonize the transport sector!\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\\\* A reduction of at least 50% in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the fossil equivalent, according to a lifecycle analysis methodology described in the RED II EU Directive. EU Directive No.2018/2001 on renewable energy sets out the exact method used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions linked to the production and use of biofuels and establishes the value of the fossil equivalent.\\n\\n The essentials of biofuels\\n\\nBiomass/Biogas \\n\\nThree generations of biofuel\\n\\n First-generation biofuels\\n\\nThey are made of:\\n\\nvegetable oils, such as sunflower or rapeseed oil;\\nsugars and starches from crops such as sugar beet, sugarcane, maize or wheat.\\n\\nToday, 97% of the biofuels produced worldwide are first-generation. These feedstocks are in direct competition with the food sector. TotalEnergies aims to phase out vegetable oil feedstocks by 2030.\\n\\nAdvanced biofuels\\n\\nAdvanced biofuels are produced from wastes and residues such as animal fats and used cooking oils, which were previously burned or discarded, but are now recovered and used to produce fuel.\\n\\nWe are actively investing in second generation feedstocks.\\n\\n Third-generation biofuels\\n\\nThe third-generation explores new potential by examining additional types of biomass. It still presents a large number of technological and economic challenges.\\n\\nOur R&D is working on solutions.\\n\\nCover\\n\\nBiomass/Biogas \\n\\nA feedstock for every purpose\\n\\nThe raw materials, or feedstocks, are selected according to the finished product:\\n\\nEthanol produced by the fermentation of sugar in sugar beet or cereals is used to produce biofuels for the gasoline market. TotalEnergies has been distributing this kind of biofuel since 1994.\\nOilseed crops such as rapeseed and sunflower, used cooking oils and animal fat are used to produce biofuels for the diesel market. We decided to invest in this market in 2019, when we started producing renewable diesel.\\n\\nAt TotalEnergies, we prefer to produce biofuels from waste and residues generated by the local economy.\\n\\nUsed cooking oil: the global potential for used cooking oils is around 15 million tons a year. Collection circuits are gradually being set up to recover these used materials from food processing plants and restaurants, especially fast food outlets.\\nAnimal fat: recycled animal fat comes from suppliers at rendering plants and abattoirs. They are subject to strict health controls. The global resource is around 10 million tons a year, with Europe alone providing just under 3 million tons.\\n\\n Until very recently, waste and residues had no value. Today, they constitute the majority of our feedstock and have to meet strict specifications from TotalEnergies as to traceabilty. But they are a very widely dispersed resource! The process of organizing their collection is underway, in response to constantly growing demand (driven by regulation) from biofuels producers, but it takes time.\\n\\n Hélène Labesse Renewable Fuels Business Unit Optimization Manager Refining & Chemicals Business Segment, TotalEnergies \\n\\n How are our biofuels produced?\\n\\nFrom the frying pan to the engine, discover the journey of our raw materials through a biorefinery like the one at La Mède in France.\\n\\nThe raw materials used can be:\\n\\nwaste and residues (used edible oils and animal fats); or\\ncertified vegetable oils (rapeseed, sunflower, etc.)\\n\\nThese raw materials go through a bleaching and degumming process.\\n\\nThey then go through the pretreatment phase. This eliminates any pollutants that could damage the catalyst in the downstream HVO unit.\\n\\nAt the same time as this pretreatment, the reforming unit (consisting of a reformer, imported gasoline stock and high-octane gasoline) generates the hydrogen needed to operate the HVO unit, while improving the octane rating of the petrol bases processed on site.\\n\\nThe hydrotreated vegetable oil unit receives the pre-treated oils and hydrogen, and has two sections in series: HDT and HDI.\\n\\nIn the HDT section, hydrotreatment transforms the oils into fuel. In the HDI section, hydrodimerization improves the fuel's resistance to cold.\\n\\nThe HVO unit produces biopropane, bionaphtha and biodiesel.\\n\\n View text version \\n\\nCover\\n\\nBiomass/Biogas \\n\\nIn addition to biorefining, there is another model for the production of biofuels in traditional refineries: co‑processing. Co-processing is the term used for the incorporation of biomass feedstock alongside the standard fossil feedstock, in a standard refinery. The refining process results in a sustainable aviation fuel.\\n\\nBiofuels: a market built by regulation\\n\\n View text version \\n\\n× \\n\\nWorld biofuel projections\\n\\nGrowth in global biofuel consumption (Mboe/d) between 2022 and 2030.\\n\\nGlobal biofuel consumption could almost double by 2030\\\\. This increase is driven primarily by renewable diesel.\\n\\nIt currently costs more to produce biofuels than fossil fuels. So the price to our customers is higher, and that reduces demand. For the market to grow and be profitable, governments need to intervene through regulation.\\n\\n It’s counterintuitive, but regulation is helping to drive biofuels: demand is growing because of the regulations. Biofuels are generally found in countries where regulations encourage their use. The percentage of biofuel in a product depends on regulations and fuel specifications, and consequently, so does the amount produced.\\n\\n Nicolas Rouquette Head of Economics Department La Mède Platform – France Refining & Chemicals Business Segment \\n\\nCover\\n\\n Sustainable aviation fuel: taking off for the future\\n\\nBiomass/Biogas \\n\\nSAF: the fuel that decarbonizes aviation\\n\\nAviation biofuel is one part of TotalEnergies’ net zero ambition, and allows us to help our customers achieve their own targets for CO2 emissions reductions. It is blended into fossil jet fuel in various proportions in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by comparison with a standard aviation fuel. So it’s a concrete alternative to fossil jet fuel, it’s available today and it satisfies sustainability criteria.\\n\\n Today, SAF is the most immediate solution for reducing CO2 emissions from air transport. In its current commercial offering, this fuel is considered “ready-to-use”, meaning that it requires no modification to engines, aircraft or ground infrastructure. The airline industry has realized the opportunity represented by this solution, which has no real economic or technological alternative currently available.\\n\\n Antoine Jaegle Director of Strategy, Climate and Aviation Development Marketing & Services Business Segment, TotalEnergies \\n\\nSAF blending mandates for EU air transport\\n\\nTrend in the proportion of SAF molecules incorporated into European air transport between 2024 and 2050:\\n\\n2024: 1.5% (in France)\\n2025: 2%\\n2030: 6%\\n2035: 20%\\n2040: 34%\\n2050: 70%\\n\\n View text version \\n\\nSustainable aviation fuel (SAF) currently costs 4 to 6 times as much as fossil jet fuel. But the SAF market is growing as the EU and other global authorities adopt blending mandates. There is also demand from the private sector (industry, business aviation, airlines, etc.), with businesses looking to achieve their net zero goals. However this is a market starting from scratch!\\n\\n TotalEnergies and SAF\\n\\nTotalEnergies’ sustainable aviation fuel is a mixture of biofuels produced from waste and residues generated by the circular economy (animal fat, used cooking oils, etc.) and JET A-1\\\\. The advantage of SAF is that it can be blended into jet fuel at a level of up to 50% depending on how it was produced, without requiring any changes to the existing logistics, infrastructure, aircraft or engines, while ensuring the same safety and product quality.\\n\\nTotalEnergies' annual SAF production targets\\n\\n2025: \\n Grandpuits: 210,000 tons \\n Normandy: 160,000 tons \\n La Mède: 15,000 tons\\n2027: \\n Grandpuits: 285,000 tons \\n Normandy: 160,000 tons \\n La Mède: 15,000 tons\\n2030: 1.5 million tons of SAF worldwide\\n\\n View text version \\n\\nOur zero-crude platform of Grandpuits is at the heart of our SAF production: with the site’s annual production capacity reaching 210,000 tons by 2025, and increasing to 285,000 tons by 2027, the Grandpuits biorefinery will help to meet demand driven by the rising EU blending mandates, set at 6% in 2030.\\n\\nFind out more about the transformation of Grandpuits\\n\\nContact\\nSuppliers\\nGeneral Terms and Conditions of Use\\nPersonal data charter, cookies and tracers\\nAccessibility : partially compliant\\nSitemap\\n© 2026 TotalEnergies\\n\\nFollow us\\n\\n \\\")\\n \\\")\\n \\\")\\n \\\")\\n \\\")\",\n    \"url\": \"https://totalenergies.com/news/news/totalenergies-biofuels-adventure-begins\",\n    \"summary\": \"TotalEnergies has launched a major biofuels initiative, detailing its production from waste materials like used cooking oil and animal fat.

Experiments were conducted at torque levels of 2, 4, and 6 Nm, with the results compared to those of conventional petroleum diesel. Key performance parameters brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), and engine noise—were analyzed alongside emissions, including hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Biodiesel alone reduced brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 19.5%, brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) by 5.9%, and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) by 5.8%. SWCNT additives moderated these reductions to 10.7%, 0.71%, and 3.7%, while MWCNTs showed reductions of 14.7%, 4.1%, and 6.4%. Emission analysis revealed substantial decreases in HC, CO, and PM (up to 89% for biodiesel, 95% for SWCNTs, and 96% for MWCNTs). However, CO2 and NOx emissions increased significantly—by up to 39.9% and 79.9% with biodiesel, 55.9% and 62.2% with SWCNTs, and 50.2% and 59.9% with MWCNTs.The findings indicate that while biodiesel and CNT additives enhance engine efficiency and reduce certain pollutants, their trade-offs in CO2 and NOx emissions necessitate further efforts to achieve a sustainable balance between performance and environmental impact.\\n\\n Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\nEvaluation of complete diesel replacement using propanol and biodiesel blends with carbon nanotube additives \\n\\nArticle Open access 11 November 2025 \\n\\n Experimental investigation and AI-based prediction of engine performance and emissions using CeO2\\\\-enhanced biodiesel blends \\n\\nArticle Open access 13 December 2025 \\n\\nPerformance optimization of ethanol blends in diesel model using Taguchi and grey relational approach \\n\\nArticle Open access 15 October 2025 \\n\\n Introduction\\n\\nThe global transportation sector remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels such as diesel, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and compressed natural gas (CNG). These fuels account for approximately 99.9% of the sector’s energy demand, highlighting their dominance in modern transportation1.\\\"). However, this reliance raises significant concerns about environmental sustainability and long-term energy security due to the finite nature of fossil fuel reserves and their impact on global energy supply2, 1953–1974 (2025).\\\"),3 modelling. Ind. Crops Products 227, 120812 (2025).\\\"),4.\\\"). Additionally, internal combustion engines (ICEs) powered by these fuels emit harmful pollutants, contributing to environmental degradation and public health risks. For example, burning one liter of diesel releases around 2.9 kg of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In 2018, the transportation sector was responsible for 22% of global energy consumption, 22% of CO2 emissions, and 14% of total GHG emissions, accelerating climate change and deteriorating air quality.\\n\\nTo address these challenges, renewable alternatives such as biofuels have gained attention. Biofuels, including fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), short-chain alcohols, and vegetable oil derivatives, offer advantages such as low sulfur content, non-toxicity, biodegradability, and reduced exhaust emissions5, 99–119 (2025).\\\"),6.\\\"),7, 11619–11636 (2023).\\\"),8.\\\"). Blending biofuels with diesel has been shown to lower emissions of smoke, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and CO2, though they often increase nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions due to their oxygenated composition, which elevates combustion temperatures9, 2082–2096 (2021).\\\"),10, 55 (2018).\\\"),11.\\\"),12, 334–350 (2014).\\\"). Unlike conventional diesel, biofuels typically contain over 10% oxygen by weight13, 2351–2359 (2022).\\\"),14 on diesel engine. Heliyon 10(4), e26519 (2024).\\\"),15, 25–31 (2021).\\\"), promoting more complete combustion and reducing incomplete combustion byproducts. Biodiesel produced from waste cooking oil (WCO) is particularly promising, as it combines sustainable energy generation with effective waste management16, 7688 (2021).\\\"),17, 976–983 (2024).\\\"),18.\\\"),19.\\\"),20.\\\"),21, 376–384 (2018).\\\").\\n\\nRecent advances have explored nanoparticle additives to further enhance biodiesel performance. Nanoparticles (1–100 nm) dispersed in base fuels form stable nanofluids, often termed “nano-diesel” in fuel applications22, 67–80 (2024).\\\"). Metal oxide nanoparticles improve combustion efficiency, increase cetane numbers, and reduce emissions such as CO, HC, and particulate matter23, 199–215 (2025).\\\"),24, 749–762 (2019).\\\"). Among these, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)—especially single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled (MWCNTs)—stand out due to their high aspect ratio, thermal conductivity, and catalytic properties, with applications spanning electronics, nanocomposites, and energy systems25 blended with three different generations of biodiesel. Environ. Sci. Pollut. Res. 30(60), 125328–125346 (2023).\\\"). Among these, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stand out due to their unique structure and catalytic properties. Specifically, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) consist of a single cylindrical graphene layer and offer exceptionally high surface area (\\\\~ 450 m2/g), superior thermal conductivity (\\\\~ 3500 W/mK), and greater oxidative reactivity, making them highly effective in enhancing fuel–air mixing, ignition quality, and combustion completeness. On the other hand, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), composed of multiple concentric graphene cylinders, demonstrate excellent thermal dissipation, mechanical stability, and moderated combustion intensity. Their layered structure facilitates heat transfer away from the combustion zone, helping reduce peak cylinder temperatures and thus suppressing NOx formation. These distinctions enable tailored applications of SWCNTs and MWCNTs in improving both performance and emissions in CI engines fueled with biodiesel26, 511–526 (2022).\\\"). Compared to other non-metallic nanoparticles such as graphene oxide, silicon dioxide (SiO2), or titanium dioxide (TiO2), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) offer several distinct advantages in biodiesel applications. Their tubular structure with high aspect ratios provides more efficient thermal pathways, enhancing in-cylinder heat distribution. Additionally, CNTs possess high electron mobility, larger surface areas (up to 450 m2/g for SWCNTs), and catalytic functional groups that improve fuel oxidation rates. These properties make them superior candidates for reducing emissions and enhancing combustion performance. Our results validate these claims, showing that CNT-based blends reduced particulate matter (PM) and CO emissions by up to 96% and 90.5%, respectively, and increased brake thermal efficiency by up to 6.4%, outperforming typical reductions achieved with other non-metallic additives in similar studies27.\\\")\\n\\nIn ICEs, CNTs enhance fuel atomization, evaporation, and combustion efficiency while reducing pollutants. Their anti-knock properties and ability to improve cetane numbers make them ideal for compression ignition (CI) engines28.\\\"). For instance, Hosseini et al.29.\\\") observed reduced CO, soot, and ultrafine particles (but higher NOx) in B5/B10 biodiesel with 30–90 ppm CNTs. Similarly, El-Seesy et al.30.\\\") identified 40 ppm MWCNTs in B20 biodiesel as optimal for efficiency and emissions reduction. Banapurmath et al.31.\\\") reported lower NOx, CO, and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) using graphene, silver, and MWCNT additives (25–50 ppm), while Ghafoori et al.32.\\\") documented a 17% power increase and 38.5% reduction in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) in a Kirloskar, single-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled diesel engine using B20 with 2.5–30 ppm CNTs. Despite these advances, gaps remain in studying higher CNT concentrations (50–150 ppm) under diverse engine conditions. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating SWCNTs and MWCNTs at elevated concentrations in WCO-derived biodiesel, linking their structural and thermal properties to combustion behavior and engine performance. This study examines how adding specific concentrations (50–150 ppm) of single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to biodiesel made from waste cooking oil affects its combustion behavior and emission properties. The research focuses on understanding how the nanoparticles’ distinct features—their surface characteristics, atomic arrangement, and heat transfer capabilities—impact important performance measures like fuel efficiency, energy usage, and the release of various exhaust components including unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and fine particles. The work aims to create improved fuel mixtures that boost engine performance while reducing the typical increase in nitrogen oxide emissions that occurs with biodiesel use. Additionally, it provides insights into developing practical applications that combine waste oil recycling with advanced material science for more sustainable fuel alternatives.\\n\\nResources, tools, and procedures\\n\\n Physical and chemical analysis of SWCNT and MWCNT nanoparticles\\n\\nThe application of several sophisticated analytical approaches yielded a comprehensive understanding of the structural, morphological, and surface properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The material’s crystalline structure and phase composition were analyzed using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO X-ray diffraction (XRD) system with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5406 Å). The XRD examination was done at 40 kV and 30 mA with a scanning range (2θ) of 10°–80°, a step size of 0.02°, and a scanning speed of 2°/min. The unique peaks in the XRD patterns confirmed the graphitic origin of the CNTs and their exceptional phase purity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using an FEI Tecnai G2 apparatus produced high-resolution pictures that were utilized to determine the nanotubes’ diameter, length, and wall structure. More than 125 randomly chosen particles from each sample were measured to assure statistical correctness and a reliable representation of size distribution. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique, based on nitrogen gas adsorption, was used to determine the specific surface area of the nanoparticles. To ensure accurate findings, samples were degassed at 105 °C for three hours to remove moisture and impurities. Each sample was examined three times, and the average results were given to assure accuracy and repeatability. The large surface area reported is highly beneficial for enhancing dispersion stability and catalytic activity in fuel blends. Furthermore, complementary studies, such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, were used to detect surface functional groups and quantify the degree of graphitization and structural flaws in CNTs. This extensive characterization is required to correlate the physicochemical features of SWCNTs and MWCNTs with their combustion behavior, fuel interaction, and emission effectiveness in internal combustion engine applications.\\n\\nProduction process of biodiesel\\n\\nThe facility responsible for accumulating waste cooking oil (WCO) was the cafeteria of Sathyabama University, located in Chennai, India. The oil, which was mainly used for deep frying, was ultimately collected after passing through a large amount of heat deterioration and oxidation, exceeding its threshold for being discarded. Initial filtering of the collected WCO was performed using a fine-mesh sieve, and then further filtration was carried out with Whatman No. 1 filter paper. This was done to eliminate suspended food particles and other pollutants. After filtration, the oil was toasted to 120 °C for 25 min to eliminate any lingering moisture, which could otherwise interfere with the transesterification reaction and lead to unwanted soap formation. A titration method was employed to determine the quantity of alkaline catalyst required to neutralize the free fatty acids (FFA) in waste cooking oil (WCO), a crucial step in biodiesel production. This was executed to ensure the transesterification process was conducted efficiently. A standard potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution was prepared by dissolving one gram of high-purity KOH pellets (Merck, 99.5%) in one liter of distilled water. This was executed to ensure the solution’s readiness for use. The titration involved the combination of a specified quantity of WCO, typically 1 g, with a designated volume of isopropyl alcohol, followed by mild heating to promote dissolution and achieve homogeneity. Subsequently, several drops of phenolphthalein indicator were added to the mixture to facilitate the visual identification of the endpoint of the titration. The KOH solution was titrated against the oil-alcohol mixture by adding it incrementally, dropwise, from a burette while continuously stirring until a stable pale pink hue emerged, indicating the neutralization of the free fatty acids (FFAs). To determine the acid value of the WCO, which correlates directly with the FFA content, the volume of the KOH solution used in this method was documented and included in the computation. Obtaining this figure is essential to ascertain the additional amount of KOH catalyst necessary for the transesterification process. This number is crucial for ensuring the conversion of all FFAs and minimizing soap formation. A precise titration optimizes the reaction parameters, enhancing both the yield and purity of the generated biodiesel. This analytical method is crucial when working with waste oils that have varying degrees of degradation and free fatty acid concentrations. This allows for the adjustment of catalyst dosage based on specific feedstock characteristics, representing a considerable benefit. Subsequently, 10 mL of isopropanol (Merck, 98.5%) was mixed with 1 mL of the WCO in a beaker. To determine the pH of the solution, 0.2 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Merck) was added dropwise until a persistent pink endpoint was observed, indicating a pH of approximately 7.5 ± 0.4\\\\. Phenolphthalein (ACS grade) was used as the pH indicator. The volume of NaOH consumed was recorded to calculate the exact amount of catalyst needed for transesterification. The transesterification process involved mixing the pretreated WCO with methanol (ACS grade, 98.8%) in a 5:1 molar ratio (methanol to oil). This ratio was selected based on previous optimization studies to ensure the complete conversion of triglycerides to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) while minimizing residual methanol. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) was added as a catalyst at a 1% weight ratio to the oil. The mixture was then subjected to magnetic stirring at 600 rpm for 7 h at a temperature of 70 °C, slightly below the boiling point of methanol, to minimize evaporation losses.\\n\\nAfter the reaction was complete, the mixture was transferred to a separating funnel and allowed to settle for twenty-four hours. Due to differences in density, glycerol settled at the bottom of the funnel and was then carefully removed. The upper biodiesel layer was washed multiple times with warm distilled water to eliminate any residual soap, catalyst, or methanol. Following the washing process, the biodiesel was heated to 700 °C to remove any remaining moisture. This procedure resulted in a final biodiesel yield exceeding 90%. The addition of carbon-based nanoparticles significantly enhanced both the fuel properties and emission characteristics of the biodiesel. Single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were selected for their exceptional thermal conductivity, high electron mobility, and ability to enhance fuel–air mixing. Previous studies have identified an optimal nanoparticle concentration of 50 parts per million (ppm), which increases combustion efficiency without significantly increasing NOx emissions33.\\\"),34.\\\").\\n\\nTo prevent agglomeration and ensure stable dispersion of the nanoparticles, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as a surfactant. The biodiesel-nanotube mixtures (BD–SWCNT and BD–MWCNT) were first subjected to ultrasonication for 45 min using a high-energy probe-type ultrasonicator, followed by mechanical stirring at 500 rpm for 2 h. This process ensured the homogeneous distribution of the nanoparticles throughout the biodiesel matrix, achieving the intended performance enhancements. The final nanoparticle-enriched biodiesel blends were stored in sealed, opaque glass containers at ambient temperature for subsequent engine testing. Comparative evaluations were conducted using plain diesel (PD), pure biodiesel (BD), and nanoparticle-enhanced blends to assess the effects of SWCNT and MWCNT incorporation on engine efficiency and pollution levels. All evaluations were conducted at the Dorra refinery using standardized ASTM protocols; Table 1 details the physicochemical properties of plain diesel (PD), biodiesel (BD), biodiesel mixed with single-walled carbon nanotubes (BD-SWCNT), and biodiesel mixed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (BD-MWCNT). Biodiesel generally has more viscosity than petroleum diesel, which may impede fuel atomization and diminish combustion efficiency. Nonetheless, due to their dispersive qualities, the inclusion of SWCNTs and MWCNTs considerably decreases viscosity, but it still surpasses that of petroleum-based diesel fuel. BD has a superior cetane number relative to PD, which enhances ignition quality and reduces ignition delay, thereby improving total combustion performance. The integration of carbon nanotubes enhances this characteristic by promoting more efficient oxidative reactions during burning. Due to BD’s inherently lower calorific value compared to PD, a higher fuel volume is required to produce the same amount of energy. Nevertheless, the incorporation of SWCNTs and MWCNTs results in a slight enhancement in energy content, attributed to increased thermal conductivity and more thorough burning. The utilization of nanoparticles created from carbon significantly improves the fuel characteristics of biodiesel, enhancing its compatibility with compression ignition engines and potentially mitigating some intrinsic constraints of its fundamental composition.\\n\\nTable 1 Key fuel characteristics of PD, BD, and biodiesel blends with carbon nanotubes.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\n Engine testing procedure\\n\\nAn experimental examination was conducted on Kirloskar brand 4-stroke, single-cylinder, air-cooled, direct-injection CI engines to determine their efficiency and emission characteristics under various operating conditions. Figure 1 provide visual representations of the experimental setup, including photographs of the engine and its components. The engine produces a maximum output power of around 4.4 kW while maintaining a constant rotational speed of 2000 rpm. It has a bore diameter of 87.5 mm and a stroke length of 110 mm, resulting in a swept volume of approximately 0.66 L. This engine is designed for diesel combustion under ordinary operating conditions and features a fixed compression ratio of 17.5:1\\\\. The fuel injection system characteristics are calibrated to the manufacturer’s standards, which include an injection pressure of 200 bar and an injection timing of 23° before top dead center (TDC). These parameters provide high combustion efficiency and accurate fuel atomization. The testing equipment is equipped with several sensors and measuring units, enabling the capture of real-time data on parameters such as fuel consumption, in-cylinder pressure, exhaust gas composition, and temperature profiles. This complete setup enables in-depth research of combustion behavior and emission characteristics across various fuel mixes and additive conditions. Table 2 provides a comprehensive description of the engine’s size, operating parameters, fuel injection settings, and mechanical characteristics.\\n\\nFig. 1\\n\\nEngine photograph from the test rig35 diesel engine.

In this work, uncertainty values were determined based on the specifications of the measuring instruments and the adopted methodologies, in alignment with established guidelines reported in previous studies. A detailed overview of the measurement ranges, instrument accuracies, and calculated percentage uncertainties for each variable is provided in Table 3. The total experimental uncertainty was determined using the Root Sum Square (RSS) approach:\\n\\n$${\\\\\\\\text{Overall uncertainty }} = \\\\\\\\, \\\\\\\\surd \\\\\\\\left( {{\\\\\\\\text{U}}^{{2}}\\\\{{{\\\\\\\\text{BP}}}} + {\\\\\\\\text{U}}^{{2}}\\\\{{{\\\\\\\\text{BTE}}}} + {\\\\\\\\text{U}}^{{2}}\\\\{{{\\\\\\\\text{BSFC}}}} + {\\\\\\\\text{U}}^{{2}}\\\\{{{\\\\\\\\text{CO}}}} + {\\\\\\\\text{U}}^{{2}}\\\\{{{\\\\\\\\text{UHC}}}} + {\\\\\\\\text{U}}^{{2}}\\\\{{{\\\\\\\\text{NOx}}}} + {\\\\\\\\text{U}}^{{2}}\\\\{{{\\\\\\\\text{Smoke}}}} + {\\\\\\\\text{U}}^{{2}}\\\\{{{\\\\\\\\text{EGT}}}} } \\\\\\\\right)$$\\n\\n (1)\\n\\nTable 3 Gadget datasheet with uncertainty numbers.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\nIn this context, U denotes the percentage uncertainty associated with each individual parameter. The specific values applied in this analysis are listed in Table 3, leading to a calculated overall experimental uncertainty of ± 2.1%.\\n\\n Key performance indicators\\n\\nThe dynamometer used to measure engine output consists of electromagnets that generate a magnetic field in which the rotors, connected flexibly to the crankshaft, rotate. Variations in the electric current flowing through the electromagnets adjust the magnetic resistance, which in turn applies a controllable load to the engine. Torque (T) is determined by multiplying the reactive force (F) measured by a strain gauge with the lever arm distance (R) from the pivot point. This arrangement enables precise detection of the mechanical load imposed on the engine. Once torque is known and the engine speed (N) is maintained constant, the brake power (BP) can be calculated,\\n\\n$${\\\\\\\\text{T }} = {\\\\\\\\text{ FR}} \\\\\\\\left( {{\\\\\\\\text{Nm}}} \\\\\\\\right)$$\\n\\n (2)\\n\\n$${\\\\\\\\text{BP }} = \\\\\\\\frac{2\\\\\\\\pi NTS}{{60}} \\\\\\\\left( {{\\\\\\\\text{kW}}} \\\\\\\\right)$$\\n\\n (3)\\n\\n\\\"S\\\" stands for the dynamometer variable. Equation (3) determines the braking power (BP) generated when the load varies from 0 to 100% while maintaining an engine speed of 1,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). Using an analog stopwatch to record the time it takes to consume a given amount of 10 cc of gasoline, as shown in Eq. (4), is the standard method for measuring fuel consumption.\\n\\n$${\\\\\\\\text{TFC }} = \\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\rho \\\\\\\\times V}{t} \\\\\\\\left( {{\\\\\\\\text{g}}/{\\\\\\\\text{s}}} \\\\\\\\right)$$\\n\\n (4)\\n\\nWhile ρ represents fuel density, v denotes fuel volume, and t represents the time recorded by a stopwatch to monitor the consumption of a specific fuel volume, typically 10 cc during engine testing, the sign TFC indicates the total fuel consumption. This measurement is crucial for determining the amount of fuel consumed under specific operating conditions. The TFC is divided by the engine’s braking power (BP) to calculate the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC). A crucial indicator of engine fuel economy, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) measures the amount of fuel required to produce one kilowatt of braking power per hour. More effective fuel use is indicated by lower brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) values. Similarly, Eq. (4), which connects the engine’s brake power output to the fuel’s energy input, is used to calculate the brake thermal efficiency (BTE). The TFC is multiplied by the fuel’s lower heating value (LHV) to determine this input energy. BTE indicates the efficiency with which the fuel’s chemical energy is converted into practical mechanical work. Better engine thermal performance is indicated by higher Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) readings. When assessing the impact of gasoline additives, such as nanoparticles, on engine behavior, BSFC and BTE are key performance metrics. These parameters are crucial for evaluating various fuel mixes and understanding their impact on power output, fuel economy, and combustion efficiency. Additionally, they provide a thorough overview of the engine’s capacity for energy conversion under various loads and operating conditions, enabling improvements in performance and environmental sustainability.\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\text{BTE}= \\\\\\\\frac{BP}{TFC\\\\\\\\times CV} \\\\\\\\times 100 \\\\\\\\left(\\\\\\\\%\\\\\\\\right)$$\\n\\n (5)\\n\\n‘CV’ refers to the calorific value of the fuel under investigation, representing the amount of energy released during its complete combustion. The air intake flow rate, a critical parameter for evaluating engine performance, is measured precisely using a U-tube manometer. This device is connected to an orifice with a diameter of approximately 20 mm, which creates a pressure differential proportional to the airflow. The volumetric flow rate of air (VA) is then calculated using Eq. (6), which takes into account the pressure difference indicated by the manometer, the orifice area, and fluid flow characteristics. Accurate measurement of airflow is essential for determining the air–fuel ratio, combustion efficiency, and overall engine performance.\\n\\n$${\\\\\\\\text{V}}\\\\{{\\\\\\\\text{A}}} {\\\\\\\\text{ }} = {\\\\\\\\text{ C}}\\\\{{\\\\\\\\text{d}}} \\\\\\\\times {\\\\\\\\text{A}} \\\\\\\\times \\\\\\\\surd \\\\\\\\left( {2{\\\\\\\\text{gH}}} \\\\\\\\right)({\\\\\\\\text{m}}^{3} )$$\\n\\n (6)\\n\\nTo reflect the flow characteristics via the orifice, the discharge coefficient (Cd) is assumed to be 0.60 for this arrangement. In units of square meters (m2), the letter A represents the orifice’s cross-sectional area, which has a direct impact on the air volume flowing through it. In a U-tube manometer, the variable H represents the height of the water column in meters (m), which is a measure of the pressure differential that drives the airflow. Finally, in the equation for the flow rate derived from the laws of fluid mechanics, g represents the acceleration due to gravity, expressed in meters per second squared (m/s2).\\n\\nEmission traits and noise assessment\\n\\nTo investigate the effect of nanoparticle incorporation in biodiesel on engine exhaust, both particles and gases released into the atmosphere were evaluated using advanced equipment commonly used in research institutions in India. A HORIBA PG-250 gas analyzer hydrocarbons (HC), the gas carbon monoxide (CO), the gas carbon dioxide (CO2), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were measured using this method. This analyzer is often used in environmental testing laboratories and automotive testing centers in India. A standardized gas flow meter was attached to a sample pipe connected to the engine’s exhaust, enabling the analyzer to measure the gases produced accurately. To ascertain the mass concentration of particulate matter, Whatman borosilicate glass fiber filters (grade GF/A) were used for particle collection, which was then subjected to pre-weighing and post-weighing using a high-precision electronic balance. This was executed in line with standard protocols. For the results to be considered credible, each test was conducted thrice, and the average values were presented for further analysis. Noise emissions were measured using Bruel and Kjaer Model 2250 sound level meters, a high-precision instrument commonly employed in noise pollution monitoring facilities across India. This apparatus was equipped with four microphones positioned at equal intervals (1 m) around the engine in the front, left, right, and rear locations. This setup enabled the comprehensive recording of sound pressure levels (in dB) while the engine operated at various torque levels, allowing a complete evaluation of the acoustic impact of the fuel mixtures.\\n\\n Findings and discussion\\n\\nArchitectural and morphological description of SWCNTs and MWCNTs\\n\\nThe XRD patterns of the SWCNT and MWCNT samples (Fig. 2) match the standard Numbers for JCPDS cards 00-058-1638 (for SWCNTs) and 00-041-1487 (for MWCNTs), confirming their characteristic graphitic crystallinity. The sharp (002) diffraction peak at \\\\~ 26° indicates the hexagonal carbon structure, while the absence of impurity peaks confirms the high purity of both samples (Azam, M. A et al.36.\\\"); Banerjee, S. 37.\\\")). SEM imaging revealed that the SWCNTs formed densely entangled bundles due to their ultrafine diameters (\\\\~ 1–20 nm), appearing as smooth, fibrous networks at higher magnification. In contrast, the MWCNTs exhibited resolved tubular structures with thicker diameters (10–30 nm) and fewer entanglements, consistent with their multi-walled architecture. Raman spectroscopy further confirmed the structural integrity, with the G-band (\\\\~ 1580 cm−1) signifying graphitic order and the D-band (\\\\~ 1350 cm−1) indicating minimal defects. The specific surface areas, measured via BET analysis, were 450 (± 20) m2/g for SWCNTs and 220 (± 15) m2/g for MWCNTs, reflecting their morphological differences. The uniformity in crystallinity and surface properties ensures a controlled comparison of their functional performance in subsequent applications.\\n\\nFig. 2\\n\\nXRD and SEM depicts of SWCNT and MWCNT nanoparticles.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 3\\n\\nFunctional Group analysis by FTIR of SWCNT and MWCNT nanoparticles.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nThe FTIR analysis clearly identified the functional groups present in each material. In the case of CNT, the spectrum showed a characteristic broad peak around 3391 cm−1, corresponding to O–H stretching vibrations from adsorbed water molecules, while the smaller peak at 2366 cm−1 was attributed to atmospheric CO2 absorption—both features typical of porous carbon materials that readily absorb moisture from the environment. The SWCNT spectrum revealed a more complex pattern with five distinct absorption bands, as illustrated in Fig. 3. A sharp peak at 3060 cm−1 indicated C–H stretching vibrations, while the strong band at 1643 cm−1 corresponded to aromatic C=C stretching. Additional peaks at 1433 cm−1 (C–H bending), 1091 cm−1 (C–O stretching), and 599 cm−1 (O–H out-of-plane bending) provided clear evidence of oxygen-containing functional groups introduced during the oxidation process, which significantly influence the material’s chemical behavior and potential applications. Achieving stable dispersion of carbon nanotubes in biodiesel presents significant challenges due to their strong tendency to aggregate through van der Waals interactions. In this study, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at a concentration of 0.5% w/v was selected as the dispersing agent based on its ability to provide effective electrostatic stabilization. The negatively charged sulfate groups of SDS molecules adsorb onto the CNT surfaces, creating sufficient electrostatic repulsion (with ζ-potential values exceeding ± 30 mV) to prevent particle aggregation. This stabilization mechanism proves particularly effective in biodiesel’s polar environment, where the ester-rich composition (with a dielectric constant between 3 and 5) supports charge stabilization. The dispersion process employed a combination of ultrasonication and mechanical mixing to achieve optimal results. Ultrasonication at 20 kHz and 50% amplitude generated intense cavitation effects, where collapsing microbubbles produced localized extreme conditions (temperatures surpassing 5000 K and pressures exceeding 1000 atm) capable of breaking apart CNT bundles through powerful hydrodynamic shear forces. To prevent overheating and potential biodiesel degradation, the ultrasonication was applied in pulsed cycles (5 s on, 2 s off), maintaining the system temperature at 25 ± 2 °C—well below the critical threshold (approximately 60 °C) where oxidative damage becomes significant. Subsequent high-shear mixing at 500 rpm for 2 h created turbulent flow conditions with eddies in the 10–100 μm range, effectively balancing the gravitational settling of CNTs (governed by Stokes’ law, where settling velocity depends on the density difference between CNTs \\\\[∼1.8 g/cm3\\\\] and biodiesel \\\\[∼0.88 g/cm3\\\\]) with turbulent diffusion forces to maintain homogeneous dispersion.\\n\\n Engine performance\\n\\nIn a four-stroke, one-cylinder, air-cooled, direct-injection CI engine, this research evaluated the performance of petroleum diesel (PD) and biodiesel (BD) made from used cooking oil. The engines were tested both before and after exposure to 50 ppm of SWCNT or MWCNT nanoparticles. Figure 4a presents the BSFC values for all evaluated instances, where BSFC represents fuel efficiency by measuring fuel consumption per unit of power generated. The results demonstrate that BD exhibited higher BSFC values than PD across all load conditions.\\n\\nThe measured BSFC values demonstrated consistent trends across all tested load conditions (2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 Nm), with petroleum diesel (PD) showing superior fuel efficiency compared to baseline biodiesel (BD). At 2.0 Nm, the BSFC values were 510 g/kWh for PD versus 636 g/kWh for BD, representing a 24.7% increase in fuel consumption for BD, which Polat et al.38.\\\") attribute to BD’s lower calorific value. The addition of carbon nanotube additives significantly improved BD’s performance, with SWCNT-doped BD (578 g/kWh) and MWCNT-doped BD (598 g/kWh) showing 9.1% and 6.0% reductions in BSFC, respectively, compared to neat BD. This improvement is consistent with Suat et al.39.\\\") findings on nanoparticle additives, resulting from enhanced oxygen availability and catalytic combustion effects. The same trend was observed at higher loads, with 4.0 Nm measurements showing BSFC values of 325 g/kWh (PD), 350 g/kWh (BD), 330 g/kWh (BD + SWCNT), and 340 g/kWh (BD + MWCNT), and at 6.0 Nm showing 268 g/kWh (PD), 300 g/kWh (BD), 285 g/kWh (BD + SWCNT), and 290 g/kWh (BD + MWCNT), demonstrating that nanoparticle additives consistently reduced BD’s fuel consumption across the entire load range while still maintaining a measurable performance gap relative to PD.\\n\\nThe experimental results demonstrate that BDSWCNT consistently outperforms BDMWCNT across all torque levels, primarily due to its higher oxygen concentration and superior calorific value. As shown in Fig. 4b, BSFC reductions at 2.0 Nm were measured at 20% for BD, 12% for BDSWCNT, and 16% for BDMWCNT, with this improvement trend becoming more pronounced at higher loads, reaching 21%, 12%, and 16%, respectively, at 4.0 Nm. These enhancements, as explained by Islam et al.40.\\\"), result from improved ignition probability and reduced fuel consumption enabled by the catalytic effects of nanoparticles. When the torque increased to its maximum threshold of 6.0 Nm, the BSFC reductions moderated slightly to 19%, 12.1%, and 16.1% for BD, BDSWCNT, and BDMWCNT, respectively, reflecting the expected stabilization of combustion efficiency at peak operational conditions. The consistent performance advantage of BDSWCNT highlights the critical importance of oxygen availability in optimizing biodiesel combustion across varying engine loads.\\n\\nAccording to Draz et al.41, 1–11 (2025).\\\"), the brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) study is a crucial tool for assessing an engine’s efficiency in transforming fuel into useful power. It uncovers essential insights regarding fuel economy. As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, BD consistently exhibits higher BSEC values than PD across all torque conditions (2, 4, and 6 Nm), recording 24.35, 12.21, and 12.13 MJ/kWh respectively, compared to PD’s 21.78, 12.56, and 10.67 MJ/kWh. While all fuels show improved efficiency (reduced BSEC) with increasing load, BD requires greater fuel consumption than PD to deliver equivalent power output, as corroborated by Megat et al.42 and emission characteristics of the direct injection spark ignition engine fuelled by hydrogen enriched compressed natural gas at various air-fuel ratios. Int. J. Appl. Eng. Res. 13(1), 677–683 (2018).\\\"). This fundamental trade-off between BD’s environmental benefits and its energy conversion efficiency highlights the technical challenges in biodiesel optimization, particularly when considering the thermodynamic limitations imposed by its lower energy density. The consistent inverse relationship between BSEC and load across all tested fuels further underscores the importance of operational conditions in assessing fuel performance metrics.\\n\\nThe experimental results demonstrate that nanoparticle additives significantly improve biodiesel’s energy efficiency by enhancing its lower heating value (LHV) while reducing fuel consumption. As shown in Fig. 5b, the brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) of the nanoparticle-blended biodiesel (BDSWCNT) reaches values of 22.78, 12.88, and 11.78 MJ/kWh at torque levels of 2, 4, and 6 Nm, respectively—significantly lower than that of unmodified biodiesel and approaching the performance levels of petroleum-based diesel (PD). The superior performance of SWCNT-modified fuel, particularly at lower loads, is attributed to its higher oxygen concentration and improved lower heating value (LHV) characteristics. While BDMWCNT shows intermediate results with losses of 0.90%, 4%, and 3.9% across the torque range, both nanoparticle formulations effectively mitigate the substantial energy losses (4.6–5.9%) observed in pure BD at higher loads. These findings confirm that carbon nanotube additives, especially SWCNTs, can optimize biodiesel combustion to achieve near-PD efficiency levels while maintaining its environmental benefits, with the performance improvements being most pronounced at lower torque conditions.\\n\\nFig. 4\\n\\n(a**) Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) values recorded for each tested fuel variant, and (b**) the percentage increase in BSFC relative to petroleum diesel (PD) across varying load conditions, all measured at a constant engine speed of 2000 rpm.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 5\\n\\n(a**) Percentage reduction in brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) compared to petroleum diesel (PD) across different torque levels at a constant engine speed of 2000 rpm, and (b**) the corresponding BSEC values for all tested fuel samples.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFigure 5 presents a comparative analysis of the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of the tested fuel blends across three different load conditions, revealing two key trends. First, all fuels exhibit improved brake thermal efficiency (BTE) with increasing torque due to reduced specific fuel consumption at higher loads. However, baseline biodiesel (BD) consistently underperforms petroleum diesel (PD) by 8–12%, primarily due to its higher viscosity and lower calorific value. Second, nanoparticle incorporation substantially narrows this performance gap, with SWCNT-enhanced BD achieving 90–95% of PD’s efficiency by improving combustion characteristics through better fuel atomization and more complete oxidation. These findings demonstrate that while inherent energy losses from heat transfer and friction persist43, 4126 (2024).\\\"), the strategic use of nanoadditives can effectively compensate for biodiesel’s thermodynamic limitations while preserving its environmental benefits.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the BTE ratios for different fuel blends and the corresponding BTE loss percentage relative to pure diesel were analyzed at an initial engine speed of 2000 rpm under varying torque conditions.The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) analysis reveals distinct performance differences among the tested fuels under varying torque conditions. Petroleum diesel (PD) achieves the highest BTE values (16.21, 28.24, and 30.75 at 2, 4, and 6 Nm, respectively), while baseline biodiesel (BD) exhibits reduced efficiency (15.67, 24.24, and 28.65) with corresponding losses of 6.7%, 6.1%, and 1.3%. The addition of nanoparticles significantly improves BD’s thermal efficiency, with SWCNT-enhanced biodiesel achieving near-PD performance (16.20, 26.95, and 30.56) and minimal losses (4.8%, 4.2%, and 0.26%), outperforming MWCNT-modified BD (14.25, 24.25, and 30.50 with 5.8%, 5.5%, and 0.73% losses). These improvements occur because nanoparticle additives compensate for BD’s inherent limitations by enhancing combustion characteristics while maintaining its environmental benefits. The efficiency gains are most pronounced at higher loads where reduced specific fuel consumption and improved combustion efficiency minimize thermal losses. SWCNT proves particularly effective in optimizing engine performance, while MWCNT exhibits complementary benefits in emissions reduction, which will be discussed subsequently. The results confirm that the strategic incorporation of nanoparticles can substantially bridge the performance gap between biodiesel and conventional diesel. The acoustic analysis reveals a consistent relationship between engine load and noise levels across all tested fuels, as demonstrated in Fig. 7 . While petroleum diesel (PD) exhibits noise levels of 80.0, 84.0, and 85.0 dB at 2, 4, and 6 Nm, respectively, baseline biodiesel (BD) shows significantly lower noise emissions (74.0, 76.0, and 78.0 dB at corresponding loads). This 6–8 dB reduction can be attributed to BD’s higher oxygen content and lower heating value, which collectively reduce peak cylinder temperatures and subsequent combustion noise (Brindhadevi et al.44.\\\"); Pham et al.45, 2011490 (2025).\\\")). Nanoparticle incorporation further enhances this acoustic performance, with SWCNT-modified BD recording noise levels of 72.0, 73.0, and 76.0 dB, and MWCNT-enhanced BD achieving noise levels of 71.0, 73.0, and 75.0 dB across the load range. The superior noise reduction of BDSWCNT compared to BDMWCNT stems from its higher oxygen concentration, leading to improved combustion efficiency. Additionally, the improved cetane numbers of both modified biodiesels (Wang et al.46.\\\")) contribute to reduced ignition delays, further minimizing combustion noise while maintaining engine performance across all operational loads. These findings demonstrate that biodiesel formulations, particularly when enhanced with carbon nanotubes, offer significant noise reduction benefits compared to conventional diesel without compromising engine functionality. The thermal properties of carbon nanotubes show some interesting differences between types. Single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) conduct heat particularly well, with measurements showing values around 3500 W/mK. That’s noticeably higher than what we see in multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs), which typically come in around 2000 W/mK. This difference comes down to how heat travels through their structures—the simpler single-layer design of SWCNTs means heat-carrying phonons encounter fewer obstacles as they move through the material47. J. Mech. Eng. (JMechE) 20(3), 313–333 (2023).\\\").\\n\\nFig. 6\\n\\n(a) BTE ratios for all sorts of fuels and (b) BTE loss % in comparison to PD at an initial engine speed of 2000 rpm and varying torque readings.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 7\\n\\n(a) The noise magnitude (dB) of all sorts of fuels and (b) the noise intensity diminution (%) in contrast to PD.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nEmission of depleted gases\\n\\nFigure 8 depicts the spectrum of emissions generated by each fuel type. Elevating the torque value generally leads to an escalation in the emissions of specific pollutants, including hydrocarbons and particulate matter. This effect is caused by the decreased combustion period, leading to an increase in the production of hydrocarbons and particulate matter. Conversely, the imposition of a greater load increased temperature, therefore causing a decrease in carbon monoxide emissions. This was achieved by decreasing the quantity of partially combusted fuel and augmenting the quantity of fully combusted fuel, leading to an escalation in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.\\n\\ndemonstrates that the addition of biodiesel (BD) significantly reduces the levels of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. This reduction is further amplified by incorporating nanoparticles, specifically single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Conversely, increasing the load results in higher emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2). Figure 9 shows the percentage reductions in hydrocarbons (HC), CO, and particulate matter (PM) achieved with three different biofuels across various load values. For instance, at 2, 4, and 6 Nm, the hydrocarbon emissions for palm biodiesel (PD) are 60.0, 110.0, and 160.0 g/h, respectively, whereas, for biodiesel (BD), these emissions are significantly lower at 6.0, 12.0, and 23.0 g/h. The reductions in HC due to BD are 95.0%, 90.0%, and 88.4% at these respective loads. When nanoparticles are added, BD with SWCNT achieves reductions of 94.0%, 90.0%, and 84.0%, while BD with MWCNT achieves reductions of 92.0%, 89.0%, and 88.8%. Overall, the reduction percentages for BDSWCNT and BDMWCNT surpass those of pure BD by 2% and 1%, respectively, with BD serving as the baseline reference. Additionally, BD with SWCNT exhibits a higher oxygen content compared to MWCNT, which further enhances its performance.\\n\\nIn comparison to the reduction percentages of BD SWCNT and BDMWCNT, both at 90.5%, the reduction percentage of CO with BD is roughly 89.5% at the minimum load value. The lowering behavior of BDSWCNT and BDSWCNT stays analogous to that of BD, even with greater load levels. The incorporation of nanoparticles and BD both facilitate a decrease in air particulate matter emissions. At distances of 2, 4, and 6 nm, the particulate matter emissions of PD are 1.7, 1.9, and 1.3 g per hour, respectively, while the particulate matter emissions of BD are 0.18, 0.16, and 0.18 g per hour, respectively. In comparison to the PD, this signifies that the percentage decline in the BD is almost 95% lower. The PM emissions of BDSWCNT at 2, 4, and 6 Nm are 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 g/h, respectively, while the PM emissions of BDMWCNT are 1.2, 1.6, and 1.6 g/h, respectively. The application of BDSWCNT and BD MWCNT leads to a further decrease in PM emissions. Compared to PD, data suggests that BD demonstrates an approximate 90% decrease in particulate matter emissions. Conversely, BDSWCNT and BD MWCNT demonstrate an average reduction in PM emissions of approximately 96% and 93%, respectively.\\n\\nFig. 8\\n\\nExhaust gas from engines running on different fuel types under different loads and maintaining a constant engine speed of 2000 rpm.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 9\\n\\nshows how the percentage of released fumes changes when the engine is running at 2000 rpm and different loads are applied.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nSazhin et al.48, 18220–18256 (2021).\\\") attribute the release of hydrocarbons to the minimal participation of diesel in combustion and evaporation processes. The significant reduction in particulate matter emissions can likewise be attributed to the same rationale. The physicochemical features of fuel facilitate the emission of carbon monoxide during burning. In low-oxygen conditions, elevated partial combustion leads to increased carbon monoxide emissions. Consequently, biodiesel-derived fuels have an elevated oxygen content, resulting in reduced carbon monoxide emissions. The unique structure of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) plays a key role in their thermal behavior. Their concentric layered design allows heat to dissipate radially, which helps moderate peak combustion temperatures49, 847–866 (2024).\\\"). This thermal regulation explains why MWCNT blends show 2–4% lower NOx emissions compared to single-walled nanotube formulations, as clearly shown in Fig. 9. Since NOx formation depends heavily on temperature, this thermal buffering effect proves particularly valuable.\\n\\nOur surface area measurements tell an equally interesting story. BET analysis revealed SWCNTs have significantly more surface area (450 ± 20 m2/g) compared to MWCNTs (220 ± 15 m2/g). All that extra surface provides more active sites where oxidation reactions can occur. This helps explain why SWCNT blends performed slightly better at reducing harmful emissions—they achieved 94% reduction in hydrocarbons versus MWCNTs’ 92%, and 90.5% reduction in carbon monoxide compared to 89% for MWCNT formulations50.

AIP Publishing LLC.\\\")\\n\\nThe observed reduction in HC, CO, and PM emissions, coupled with increased CO2 production, indicates complete combustion when using BD and its nanoparticle blends (BD-SWCNT and BD-MWCNT) compared to PD. This enhanced combustion efficiency stems from the fuels’ higher oxygen content, which promotes thorough oxidation of the fuel. While BD inherently leads to greater fuel consumption and CO2 emissions than PD the incorporation of nanoparticles mitigates this effect by improving combustion efficiency, thereby limiting the increase in CO2. The combined effects of elevated oxygen content, increased combustion temperatures, and higher engine torque collectively contribute to this optimized combustion behavior, where substantially reduced harmful emissions (HC, CO, PM) are achieved at the expense of a controlled rise in CO2 output.\\n\\nThe increase in nitrogen oxide production indicates the impact of elevated combustion temperatures (Ozgen et al.51.\\\")). Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are generated when atmospheric nitrogen dioxide interacts with oxygen derived from fuel, nanoparticles, or air. Increasing the combustion temperature and the concentration of accessible oxygen amplifies this process. To explain, at 2, 4, and 6 Nm, the NOx emissions of PD are 99.0, 108.4, and 116.7 ppm, respectively. The NOx emissions of BD are 159.0, 188, and 201 ppm, respectively. According to these data, using BD instead of PD increases NO emissions by around 75% at 2 and 4 Nm and by about 80% at 6 Nm. The incorporation of nanoparticles may reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. The disparity in NO emissions between MWCNT and SWCNT may be attributed to the decreased oxygen concentration in MWCNT. A detailed analysis reveals that at 2, 4, and 6 Nm, BDSWCNT produces 144.0, 169, and 196 ppm of NOx, respectively, while BDMWCNT emits 142.0, 160.0, and 190.0 ppm of NOx, as stated. The findings indicate that the percentages of NO emissions rose by 48.0%, 50.3%, and 62.5% with the application of BDSWCNT at 2, 4, and 6 Nm, respectively. The respective percentages of NO emissions with the usage of BDSWCNT were 48.3%, 45.6%, and 58.8%\\n\\nBecause SWCNT and MWCNT nanoparticles exhibit different physicochemical characteristics and catalytic behaviors when they are burned, it is possible to provide a mechanistic explanation for the changes in CO2 and NOx emissions that are related to the use of these nanoparticles. It is well known that SWCNT when in its anatase form, has a considerable oxidizing capacity. This ability leads to increased combustion temperatures and improves fuel oxidation (Chen et al.52.\\\")). Over the last several years, this characteristic has garnered considerable attention for SWCNTs. This increase in temperature facilitates the atmospheric reaction between nitrogen dioxide and oxygen, leading to a greater release of nitrogen oxides into the environment. However, the enhanced temperature conditions result in a larger production of NOx emissions. This is despite the increased oxygen content in SWCNT compared to MWCNT, which makes combustion more complete. MWCNT, in contrast to SWCNT, exhibits distinctive thermal properties and has a lower propensity to generate excessive heat. There is a reduction in peak temperatures as a result of the MWCNT’s capacity to effectively dissipate heat from the exhaust after ignition, which in turn helps minimize the production of nitrogen oxides.\\n\\nThe Statistics above were applied to the data using analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the degree of dissimilarity between the means of more than two groups. This research was conducted to determine whether there was a discernible difference in the use of PD and BD derived from waste oils incorporating SWCNT and MWCNT nanoparticles. All _P_ values are lower than 0.02, as shown by the results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) presented in the Electronic Supplementary Materials (ESM) available online for this article. Because this demonstrates that all the observed changes contain significant improvements—and that these improvements are respectable—and are not merely random fluctuations, it provides strong support for the dependability of the observed data.\\n\\nSeveral factors may influence the cost and scalability of biodiesel additives. Although the preceding research indicated that adding nanoparticles to BD increases its performance, there are several other aspects that could affect its affordability. The techniques for production, the availability of raw materials, and market demand are all constituents of this group of variables. Because both single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes are easily accessible and can be manufactured through simple processes such as chemical precipitation and sol–gel techniques, it is not difficult to increase the production of these nanotubes for commercial use53, 1237–1265 (2013).\\\"). They are also widely available. It is necessary to compare these expenses to the benefits of increased fuel economy and reduced emissions in order to determine whether it is feasible from a financial standpoint to proceed with expanding this approach. The use of waste sunflower oil as a feedstock for biodiesel production encourages recycling and minimizes waste, which in turn reduces the negative environmental impact of waste sunflower oil. However, the addition of nanoparticles increases the cost of the fuel. A preliminary calculation suggests that the initial expense in nanoparticle manufacturing would be substantial; however, the advantages of reduced pollutants and improved fuel economy would more than offset this. The growing demand for cleaner fuels, in conjunction with the tightening of emission rules, provides further evidence that incorporating nanoparticles into biodiesel is a financially feasible choice.\\n\\nWhen compared to traditional and alternative renewable liquid fuels, nanoparticle-enhanced biodiesel offers significant environmental advantages. Carbon nanotubes (SWCNT/MWCNT) may be used to reduce emissions more effectively in biodiesel. This is notably true for hazardous pollutants, including hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM), which can be reduced by up to 96%, 90.5%, and 96%, respectively, compared to petroleum diesel. Although the entire combustion process inevitably produces an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, this trade-off is environmentally justifiable due to the significant decrease in more detrimental emissions to the environment, such as pollutants and carbon monoxide. Biodiesel continues to pose a significant environmental hazard due to its oxygen-rich composition and high combustion temperatures, which lead to increased NOx emissions. These emissions are 45–80% higher than those from regular diesel. In contrast, other renewable energy sources, such as ethanol, often have lower NOx profiles and carbon footprints than the alternatives listed below. Nonetheless, the current study on nanoparticles shows that there is a possibility for reducing this issue. MWCNT blends have been demonstrated to reduce NOx levels by two to four percent more than unmodified biodiesel. When considering the whole lifetime, nanoparticle-enhanced biodiesel provides a compelling argument for long-term use. This is especially true when paired with innovative technologies for reducing NOx emissions, such as selective catalytic reduction or exhaust gas recirculation systems. As a result of the fuel’s compatibility with the existing diesel infrastructure and its capacity to utilize a diverse range of feedstock sources, it enhances its position as a potential transitional fuel in the transition to carbon–neutral energy systems.\\n\\n Conclusion\\n\\nThis experimental study demonstrates that waste cooking oil-derived biodiesel, when enhanced with carbon nanotube additives, presents a viable alternative fuel with significant environmental benefits. Our systematic investigation reveals three key findings:\\n\\nThe base biodiesel formulation achieved substantial emission reductions, decreasing hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by 89–95% compared to conventional diesel, while maintaining acceptable engine performance parameters. These improvements stem from the fuel’s oxygenated molecular structure promoting more complete combustion.\\nThe incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) effectively addressed several biodiesel limitations. Single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) with their high surface area (450 ± 20 m2/g) and tetragonal-anatase crystalline structure enhanced combustion efficiency by 3.7–6.4%. Multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) demonstrated superior heat transfer capabilities through their concentric layered structure, helping mitigate NOx emissions—a persistent challenge in biodiesel applications.\\nThe study identified remaining technical challenges requiring further research, particularly the trade-off between reduced particulate emissions (95% decrease) and increased NOx levels (45–80% higher). The nanoparticle additives partially alleviated but did not eliminate this fundamental biodiesel characteristic.\\nThese findings make significant contributions to sustainable fuel development by validating waste cooking oil as a practical and effective biodiesel feedstock, demonstrating its successful conversion into a viable fuel source while addressing waste management challenges. The study establishes optimal carbon nanotube (CNT) concentration ranges of 50–150 ppm that effectively enhance fuel performance, providing crucial guidance for future formulation development. Furthermore, the research generates valuable empirical data on nanoparticle-mediated combustion improvement, specifically quantifying how single-walled and multi-walled CNTs influence key parameters such as combustion efficiency (3.7–6.4% improvement), emission reduction (up to 95% decrease in particulate matter), and thermal management. These combined outcomes advance our understanding of nano-additive applications in alternative fuels and provide a scientific foundation for developing more sustainable transportation energy solutions that balance environmental benefits with practical engine performance requirements.\\n\\nProspective research\\n\\nIn further research, the primary focus should be on identifying solutions to substantial empirical obstacles that arise during the development and implementation of nanoparticle-enhanced biodiesel. To begin, it is essential to conduct thorough lifecycle assessments to determine the overall environmental benefits, considering the rising levels of gaseous oxides and carbon dioxide emissions. It is vital to conduct a comprehensive evaluation under various storage conditions and for a short period to achieve the second objective, which is to establish the durability of nanoparticle dispersion in biodiesel over an extended period. Third, there is a need for a study to be conducted to evaluate the potential wear impact that nanoparticle residues in combustion chambers and fuel systems may have on engine durability. A comprehensive cost–benefit analysis is required to determine whether the manufacture of nanoparticles on a large scale and the modification of biodiesel are economically viable. In the fifth place, research needs to be conducted to determine the ideal quantities of nanoparticles that strike a balance between reducing pollution and improving engine performance under various operating conditions. Ultimately, research into the synergistic interactions between nanoparticles and NOx-reduction technology (such as EGR or SCR systems) may provide options to mitigate biodiesel’s inherent environmental downsides while retaining its emission-reduction benefits for other pollutants. The advancement of these research areas is crucial for making the transition from laboratory accomplishments of nanoparticle-enhanced biodiesel to the development of engine solutions that are both functional and environmentally friendly.\\n\\n Limitations\\n\\nThe study is limited by the short-term engine testing conditions, which may not reflect long-term operational effects.\\n\\nData availability\\n\\nThe datasets used and/or analysed during the current study available in the manuscript.\\n\\n Abbreviations\\n\\nBD:\\n\\nBiodiesel\\n\\nBSEC:\\n\\nBrake-specific energy consumption, MJ/kWh\\n\\nBSFC:\\n\\nBrake-specific fuel consumption, g/kWh\\n\\nBTE:\\n\\nBrake thermal efficiency, %\\n\\nCNT:\\n\\nCarbon nanotube\\n\\nCO:\\n\\nCarbon monoxide\\n\\nCO2 :\\n\\nCarbon dioxide\\n\\nHC:\\n\\nHydrocarbons\\n\\nMWCNT:\\n\\nMulti-walled carbon nanotube\\n\\nNOx :\\n\\nNitrogen oxides\\n\\nPD:\\n\\nPetroleum diesel\\n\\nPM:\\n\\nParticulate matter\\n\\nSWCNT:\\n\\nSingle-walled carbon nanotube\\n\\nWCO:\\n\\nWaste cooking oil\\n\\nρ:\\n\\nFuel density, g/cm3\\n\\nθ:\\n\\nCrank angle, degrees\\n\\nλ:\\n\\nAir–fuel ratio\\n\\nη:\\n\\nEfficiency, %\\n\\nΔP:\\n\\nPressure difference, Pa\\n\\nμ:\\n\\nDynamic viscosity, cSt\\n\\nφ:\\n\\nEquivalence ratio\\n\\nb:\\n\\nBrake\\n\\ni:\\n\\nIndicated\\n\\nmax:\\n\\nMaximum\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nÇılğın, E.

This research brief examines how the Indonesian government could establish a Used Cooking Oil Fund (UCOF) to support SAF production through export levy revenues, similar to the successful Palm Oil Estate Fund model used for biodiesel. \\n\\nThe analysis surveys UCO collection practices across Asian countries and evaluates three potential service fee structures on UCO exports. Our findings indicate that implementing a service fee above $150 per ton could generate sufficient revenue to subsidize UCO-based hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) fuel production, helping Indonesia meet its 1% SAF blending target by 2027. \\n\\nPolicy considerations:\\n\\nCentralize UCO collection regulations. Indonesia’s decentralized collection scheme has achieved below 50% collection rates. Central government oversight with clear producer responsibilities could significantly improve UCO supply.\\nEstablish a Used Cooking Oil Fund. Following the successful model for palm oil biodiesel, a UCOF could provide incentives either for UCO collection or directly to HEFA producers to achieve price parity with conventional jet fuel.\\nIncrease the UCO export service fee. Raising the current 9.5% service fee to above $150/ton would generate sufficient revenue to support the 1% SAF blending mandate while creating surplus funds for future program expansion.\\n\\nDownload \\n\\nDecarbonizing Transport Alternative fuels \\n\\nSector Aviation Fuels \\n\\nPolicies Fiscal policies Fuels \\n\\nSeries Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) \\n\\nRegion Asia & Pacific \\n\\n Related Content\\n\\nWorking Paper \\n\\nProducing high quality biodiesel from used cooking oil in Indonesia\\n\\nAugust 21, 2023\\n\\nWorking Paper \\n\\nProduksi biodiesel berkualitas tinggi dari minyak jelantah di Indonesia\\n\\nAugust 23, 2023\\n\\nJoin our mailing list to keep up with ICCT’s latest research and analysis.\\n\\nTwitter\\nYouTube\\nLinkedIn\\nBluesky\\n\\nContact Us \\n\\n© 2026 International Council on Clean Transportation.

The program recycles used cooking oil and grease into clean-burning, locally-made biodiesel fuel.\\n\\n“Cooking oil should never be poured down the drain as it turns solid in the pipes and can cause major clogs and issues,” said Ariel Kanupp, Catawba County recycling coordinator. “Do yourself and your neighbors a favor by disposing of your oil safely instead of clogging the sewers this holiday season.”\\n\\nTo recycle used cooking oil, allow leftover oil to cool before pouring it into a jar with a lid. Take it to one of the following locations during operating hours and carefully pour it into the appropriate recycling bin:\\n\\nRocky Ford Rd Convenience Center – 3864 Rocky Ford Rd, Newton | Mon-Sat 10am-6pm\\nBethany Church Rd Convenience Center – 2436 Bethany Church Rd, Newton | Tues-Sat 10am-6pm\\nCooksville Convenience Center – 3659 Rhoney Farm Rd, Vale | Fri & Sat 8am-6pm\\nOxford Convenience Center – 4637 Lookout Dam Rd, Catawba | Wed-Sat 10am-6pm\\n\\nAvailable year-round, the County’s cooking oil recycling program is free of charge to Catawba County residents and is open to residents of Catawba County only. No business waste is accepted. \\n\\n“Used cooking oil is the most environmentally sustainable raw material for biodiesel production,” said Kanupp. “Recycling it is a much better alternative to disposal, because the fuel it creates is environmentally friendly and can be used in any diesel engine. Recycling this cooking byproduct is not only good for the environment, it’s incredibly easy thanks to the 5 locations made available in our County.”\\n\\nFor more information about the County’s cooking oil recycling program or recycling in general, call Catawba County Utilities & Engineering at 828-465-8217 or visit www.catawbacountync.gov.\\n\\nAnimal Services\\nBoard of Commissioners\\nBudget\\nBuilding Codes & Services\\nClerk of Court\\nCounty Manager\\nE911 Communications\\nElections\\nEmergency Medical Services\\nEmergency Services\\nEnvironmental Health\\nFinance\\nGeospatial Information Services(GIS)\\nHuman Resources\\nLibrary\\nParks\\nPermit Center\\nPlanning & Parks\\nPublic Health\\nPurchasing\\nRegister of Deeds\\nSheriff's Office\\nSocial Services\\nSoil & Water Conservation\\nSolid Waste/Recycling\\nTax\\nTechnology\\nUtilities & Engineering\\nVeteran's Services\\nFeatured Catawbans\\nMy Catawba County\\n\\n---\\n\\n Recent News Posts\\n\\nCounty Operations for Wednesday January 29\\nCatawba County Terminates State of Emergency\\nSeniors Morning Out Activities February 2026\\nDelayed opening Tuesday for Catawba County government offices; Parks, Landfill, Convenience Centers remain closed\\nCounty Government Facilities Closed Monday, Jan. 26\\nState of Emergency Declared\\n\\nYour County Government\\n\\nADA Compliance\\nAwards\\nBoard of Commissioners\\nCatawba County Code\\nCatawba County Profile and History\\nCatawba County Calendar\\nEmployee Access\\nEmployee Phones and Email\\n\\n Online Services\\n\\nCommunity Alert System\\nDatasets\\nLibrary Online Catalog\\nOnline Deed Search\\nOnline Payments\\nStreet Sign Reporter\\nVehicle Tax Receipts\\nReal Estate Maps\\nReal Estate Sale Analysis\\nRegional Address Finder\\nTax Bill Search\\nRestaurant Sanitation Scores\\n\\nCounty Services\\n\\nAnimal Services\\nBudget\\nBuilding Codes & Services\\nClerk of Court\\nCooperative Extension\\nCounty Manager\\nE911 Communications\\nEconomic Development Corp.\\nElections\\nEmergency Medical Services\\nEmergency Services\\nEnvironmental Health\\nFacility Services\\nFinance\\nGeospatial Information Services (GIS)\\nHuman Resources\\nLibrary\\nParks\\nPermit Center\\nPlanning\\n\\n County Services\\n\\nPublic Health\\nPurchasing\\nRegister of Deeds\\nSheriff's Office\\nSocial Services\\nSoil & Water Conservation\\nSolid Waste/Recycling\\nTax\\nTechnology\\nUtilities & Engineering\\nVeteran's Services\\n\\nStay Connected\\n\\n---\\n\\n *Non-Discrimination Policy *\\n*Non-Discrimination Policy Grievance Procedure *\\n *Non-Discrimination Policy Grievance Complaint Form *\\nGrievance Form Final (Hmong) || Grievance Form Final (Spanish)\\nNon-Discrimination Policy (Hmong) || Non-Discrimination Policy (Spanish)\\n* Grievance Procedure (Hmong) || Grievance Procedure (Spanish)\\n\\nCopyright 2020\\\\.

Used cooking oil (often shortened to UCO) is vegetable oil or animal fat that has already been used for cooking or frying food. After it’s used, instead of being thrown away, it can be collected, filtered, and processed for reuse—most commonly as a feedstock for renewable fuels.\\n\\nThe United States—a nation of plentiful restaurants, fast food joints, and deep-fried treats imports a waste commodity that’s domestically abundant. You’re not alone in raising an eyebrow at that fact, it’s an interesting trade practice. \\n\\nLet’s start with the purpose of acquiring UCO. The United States imports large volumes of used cooking oil to make renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Because used cooking oil is a waste-based feedstock, it qualified for compliance credits under the Renewable Fuel Standard up until recently. Over the summer, Congress passed a major package of tax and clean energy reforms that tightened eligibility for the clean fuel production credit (45Z). Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” includes a provision disqualifying certain imported feedstocks—such as Chinese UCO and foreign tallow—from receiving U.S. clean fuel incentives. Now, regulatory agencies work to develop the legal framework to enforce these changes. \\n\\nImports surged beginning in 2021–2022 as U.S. renewable diesel capacity ramped up. China supplies roughly 60–70 percent of U.S. imports, helped by its large population and restaurant sector, lower collection costs, and established export logistics. It’s important to note China has drastically different labor laws than the U.S., allowing for low labor costs, which translates into a cheaper product. Refineries operated by companies such as Neste, Marathon, and Diamond Green Diesel lean on these readily available and cost-saving streams to keep units running. \\n\\nOn its face, the financial logic could be straightforward: imported UCO is plentiful, relatively cheap per gallon, and is integrated into efficient export supply chains. The economics favor imports in the short run. Shipping and landed costs for foreign UCO can keep delivered material in the neighborhood of roughly the low-$1s per gallon equivalent, while a new U.S. pre-treatment plant requires $10–$20 million for a 5–10 million gallon unit and $40–$80 million for a 50–100 million gallon unit, even if operating costs are only a few dimes per gallon once built.\\n\\nCarbon is where domestic supply holds a clear advantage. UCO collected at home for renewable diesel commonly certifies at very low carbon intensities because trucks travel shorter distances and pre-treatment loads are modest. Meanwhile imported streams can score materially higher after ocean shipping and foreign energy mixes are included. As a simple illustration, replacing half of a recent record import year’s UCO volumes with domestic supply would reduce three-quarters of a million metric tons of CO₂ annually, even before considering any batches that might be misclassified abroad. Avoiding a single large trans-Pacific shipment can eliminate several thousand tons of CO₂ tied solely to freight.\\n\\nWhile this seems like a no-brainer to farm country, some industry groups (notably parts of the refining/oil sector) push back, arguing that U.S. supply won’t suffice to meet mandated blending volumes without imports.\\n\\nIts not that domestic collection isn’t occurring, many American firms already source and process domestic UCO. Darling Ingredients, through its DAR PRO network, collects restaurant grease nationwide and supplies Diamond Green Diesel. Chevron’s Renewable Energy Group operates plants that pre-treat and convert U.S. waste oils, including through SeQuential on the West Coast. Mahoney Environmental partners with national chains, and regional firms like Baker Commodities and others round out collection. The domestic system spans about 15 states with significant collection and pre-treatment capacity—Texas, Iowa, Illinois, California, Missouri, Minnesota, Louisiana, Oregon, Washington, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska—yet it is not large enough to meet the pace of renewable diesel expansion.\\n\\nCould the U.S. find more supply at home? Potentially, but only with better infrastructure. Gaps persist in rural pickups, small-restaurant access, and institutional generators like schools, prisons, and military bases. Additional aggregation hubs, standardized pickup systems and containers, more pre-treatment capacity, and modern traceability tools could unlock significant volumes. Policy that specifically rewards U.S.-sourced waste oil—alongside grants or financing for new pre-treat units—would accelerate build-out. The biggest untapped opportunities sit in the Southeast; dense but under-captured urban corridors of the Midwest and Rust Belt; the Southwest and Mountain West where oil often travels long distances for cleaning; large institutional kitchens; and at major ports where cruise and shipping operations generate recoverable oil. With the right logistics and incentives, the United States could plausibly double or even triple current domestic recovery, reducing dependence on imports while supporting farm markets and local jobs.\\n\\nQuality and processing details shape the debate. China generally cleans and dehydrates UCO before export to meet basic specifications, but what arrives is still a technical feedstock. U.S. refiners reprocess it—degumming, neutralizing, bleaching, and filtering—before hydrotreating. Domestic UCO often reaches processors cleaner and more consistent because it moves through shorter, regulated chains with direct contracts, which also simplifies audits. These differences in chain length and oversight underpin traceability and fraud concerns around some foreign cargoes.\\n\\nGlobally, there’s a growing body of evidence, reporting, and investigative pressure pointing to suspicions and alleged instances of fraud or adulteration in Chinese (and other Asian) UCO exports. \\n\\nTransport & Environment’s briefing “Used Cooking Oil: The Certified Unknown” argues that chemically, waste cooking oil and refined virgin vegetable oils can be extremely similar, making lab tests only weakly diagnostic. Audit trails, documentation, and chain-of-custody are often the only reliable check. Because of that, the system relies heavily on paperwork audits rather than full lab confirmation, giving bad actors room to mislabel or mask origin.\\n\\nAnother Transport & Environment’s analysis shows that in many countries (especially in Asia), reported export volumes of UCO exceed credible collection estimates—suggesting some of the exported material must come from sources outside legitimate waste oil streams. Take into consideration Chinese SAF plants already absorb substantial volumes of UCO domestically—with 100,000 to 120,000 tons of UCO being used each month in China’s own biofuel / SAF productions.\\n\\nThe Transport & Environment report cites multiple cases in Europe where imported biodiesel or waste-oil-based fuels were reviewed and found to be based on mislabelled feedstocks. The same report notes that Europe historically identified hundreds of suspicious shipments from China, prompting tightened customs scrutiny and rejections of some imports.\\n\\nWhile the evidence is not uniformly definitive, it’s strong enough to be taken seriously by U.S. regulators, senators, and biofuel companies. \\n\\nIn June 2024, a bipartisan group of farm-state senators sent a letter to the EPA, USDA, U.S. Trade Representative, and Customs, asking for stronger enforcement and transparency around rising UCO imports from China and other countries, citing fraud and mislabeling risks.\\n\\nMore recently, Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) joined calls for the EPA to finalize rules on RINs for imported biofuels and to hold firm on biomass-based diesel volume mandates, with emphasis on protecting domestic agriculture. Senators have also urged the EPA to finalize the “Set 2” RFS rule with strong biomass-based diesel targets and provisions that favor domestic feedstocks.\\n\\nEven as Congress and the agencies press reform, legal and practical challenges remain—for instance, refining complex rules distinguishing domestic vs. imported feedstocks without violating WTO or trade obligations.\\n\\nBecause domestic collection capacity and feedstock availability lag demand, overly aggressive restrictions on imports could strain supply or raise fuel costs. Enforcement of traceability rules for imports demands substantial audit, testing, and verification infrastructure, which is still evolving.\\n\\nContinuing to import waste oils keeps renewable diesel and SAF capacity fully utilized at attractive short-run costs, but it perpetuates strategic dependence and traceability disputes. Investing to expand domestic collection and pre-treatment—especially across the Southeast, urban Midwest, and institutional generators—builds a cleaner, verifiable, home-grown feedstock base that supports the agricultural economy, reduces lifecycle emissions, and hardens the supply chain against geopolitical shocks. The technology is proven, the companies exist, the credit frameworks are in place, and the untapped supply is real. What remains is scaling domestic infrastructure to match America’s ambition in low-carbon fuels. Additional aggregation hubs, standardized containers and routing, more pre-treatment capacity, and modern traceability tools could unlock significant volumes. Policy that specifically rewards U.S.-sourced waste oil—alongside grants or financing for new pre-treat units—would accelerate that build-out.\\n\\n Related Posts\\n\\n Ag News /\\n Legislation to Delist the Mexican Wolf Advances, Offering Long-Overdue Relief to Cattle Producers \\n\\nJanuary 28, 2026/\\n\\n Ag News /\\n Moisture is a Concern in Parts of South America \\n\\nJanuary 28, 2026/\\n\\n Ag News /\\n Farmer Protests in Paris Highlight High Stakes of EU–Mercosur Trade Deal \\n\\nJanuary 28, 2026/\\n\\n Ag News /\\n Rollins Applauds Trump’s Support for Nationwide E-15 as Congress Weighs Legislation \\n\\nJanuary 28, 2026/\\n\\n Ag News /\\n NFU Urges USDA to Restore Prevent Plant Buy-Up Coverage \\n\\nJanuary 28, 2026/\\n\\n Ag News /\\n John Deere Announces Major Expansion with Two New U.S. Facilities Coming \\n\\nJanuary 28, 2026/\\n\\nThe American Ag Network is a nationwide radio, digital and multimedia ag news network based in Fargo, ND.\\n\\n Facebook-f Icon-twitter-x Instagram \\n\\nAmerican Ag Network © 2026 Powered by OneCMS™ | Served by InterTech Media LLC \\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nAre you still listening?\\n\\n I'm still listening \\n\\n 2732386949 \\n\\n Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\\\\15\\\\7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/143.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 \\n\\n 5b45c55204f070f5cc7f90f189b25b05d1880dd0 \\n\\n 1\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.americanagnetwork.com/2025/10/16/used-cooking-oil-becomes-the-latest-flashpoint-in-u-s-china-trade-battle/\",\n    \"summary\": \"President Donald Trump is considering blocking imports of used cooking oil from China, citing China's halt of U.S. soybean purchases as an \\\"Economically Hostile Act.\\\" U.S. imports of this waste-based feedstock for renewable fuel production surged recently, with China supplying 60–70% of the volume.\",\n    \"search_query\": \"“used cooking oil” Biodiesel\",\n    \"publication_date\": \"2025-10-16T03:00:00.000-04:00\",\n    \"prompt\": null,\n    \"additional_formats\": null,\n    \"source\": \"Website\",\n    \"source_name\": \"“used cooking oil” Biodiesel\",\n    \"mode\": null\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"Buffalo Biodiesel claims progress on permit\",\n    \"content\": \"No content found\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/news/buffalo-biodiesel-food-cooking-oil-recycler-fuels-permit-negotiations-dec/\",\n    \"summary\": \"The provided content area was empty or no specific information was found to analyze and summarize.

After a week of frying frites, the kitchen at Washington’s famous standby for French cuisine was full to bursting with used grease.\\n\\nTwo waist-high storage tanks in the back of the restaurant sloshed to the brim with dark, viscous oil. During the weekend rush, the staff stored some of the spent grease in plastic tubs, but they were quickly running out of places to put it.\\n\\nRestaurants are prohibited from dumping grease down the drain because it would clog city sewers. So on a Tuesday afternoon, James Howell nimbly backed his truck into an alley behind Le Diplomate. He hopped down from the cab and snaked a rubber hose to the kitchen. Then with the flip of a switch and a loud drone, the hose slurped the used cooking oil into the truck’s gleaming steel 2,200-gallon tank.\\n\\nJames Howell of Mahoney Environmental collects used cooking oil behind Duke’s Grocery in Washington.

(Ilvy Njiokiktjien/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe spent grease that restaurants unload as waste has become a valuable commodity. If you’ve been on a plane lately, there’s a chance that used cooking oil has helped launch you into the sky. Refineries recycle waste oil into kerosene pure enough to power a Boeing 777\\\\. The process is expensive — but it can create 70 to 80 percent less planet-warming pollution than making jet fuel out of crude oil, experts say.\\n\\nLast year, airlines burned 340 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — nearly all of it made from used cooking oil or animal fat left over from meat packaging.\\n\\n Climate Leap\\n\\nA series examining innovative and impactful approaches to addressing waste.\\n\\nPreviousNext\\n\\nThat’s a drop in the bucket compared with the 114 billion gallons of fuel airlines burned overall, which create 2.5 percent of humanity’s carbon pollution, according to the International Energy Agency. But airlines have vowed to use much more SAF to lower their greenhouse emissions. European regulators have set strict rules requiring airlines to use more SAF over time, while U.S. regulators dole out tax credits to coax companies into buying it.\\n\\nThis is the airlines’ main plan for dealing with their greenhouse emissions. Upgrading new planes with more efficient engines helps a little. And, one day, planes may run on electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells — but those are still decades away and may never work for long flights. To manage most of their climate impact for the foreseeable future, airlines are betting everything on alternative fuels.\\n\\nStory continues below advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Ninety-eight percent of \\\\[our greenhouse emissions\\\\] come from the fuel we burn,” said Lauren Riley, chief sustainability officer at United Airlines. “We’ll continue to look everywhere we can around technology and innovation of the aircraft itself and the engine, but we have to look at replacing our fuel.”\\n\\nExperts say this plan can work, but it will require fuel refiners to dramatically raise SAF production and find new raw materials besides old cooking oil to turn into kerosene. Depending on what they use and how they refine it, this new class of fuel could make flying more sustainable or cause a whole new set of environmental headaches.\\n\\nHowell, of Mahoney Environmental, collects used cooking oil in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\\n\\nHarvesting the world’s grease\\n\\nOn his rounds one day in early May, Howell made about two dozen stops at commercial kitchens around Washington, including an upscale cafe in the Michelin Guide, an assisted-living facility, a soul food spot where old chicken bones clogged the hose and an Italian restaurant where two unfortunate rats had drowned in a grease bin while diving for a wayward meatball. By midafternoon, his truck had about 1,200 gallons of grease in its belly.\\n\\nThe company he works for, Mahoney Environmental, pays a few cents a gallon forthe waste fat it collects from 90,000 businesses in the United States. Hundreds of companies gather grease around the globe — with an especially large haul in Southeast Asia, where densely packed restaurants serve up so much fried food that they’ve become the waste oil equivalent of Saudi Arabia’s rich petroleum fields.\\n\\nWaste oil from kitchens and animal tallow left over from meatpacking plants used to be recycledinto livestock feed. But now, they are mostly turned into fuel: Fat molecules hold a lot of energy, and they are relatively easy to rearrange into diesel and kerosene.\\n\\nTurning fat into fuel keeps grease out of the landfill and petroleum in the ground. The demand, though, has begun to outstrip the supply.\\n\\n“There’s only so many waste oils to go around, and … you can’t really squeeze out much more,” said Nikita Pavlenko, who leads the aviation and fuels team at the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation. “People aren’t going to be frying more food or processing more cattle to get waste tallow to make fuel. You’re kind of stuck with what you have.”\\n\\nA hose is deployed to suck used cooking oil into the tank of a collection truck. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\\n\\nStorage tanks for the feedstock (oil or tallow) at Neste in Rotterdam. (Ilvy Njiokiktjien/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nAs regulators push companies to buy and make more fuel from fat, the price of grease has been rising, along with the crime surrounding it.\\n\\nThieves sometimes steal grease from collection bins and sell it themselves. Once, Howell said, he stopped at a restaurant only to find an empty bin and a confused cook, who told him an unmarked van had come by earlier and siphoned off their oil.\\n\\nGrease fraud is a problem, too. In some areas, used cooking oil sells for more than new cooking oil, prompting hucksters to sell virgin oil — including palm oil, which is associated with deforestation in Southeast Asia — as if it were used. It’s hard to catch, since fresh oil spiked with a little restaurant grease is almost indistinguishable from the real thing.\\n\\nStory continues below advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“You’re potentially paying a premium for something that is worse than fossil fuel,” Pavlenko said.\\n\\nFuel companies crack down on fraud by hiring inspectors to go out and check that their grease suppliers really are pumping their product out of deep fat fryers. On his route, Howell takes pictures of every bin before and after he drains it and uploads the proof to a Mahoney Environmental app that verifies where his oil came from.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Howell unloads his truck at a depot, where the oil is filtered to remove water, flour, spices and any other floating food chunks.\\n\\nLaboratory Analyst Diederik Schuitemaker in the laboratory at Neste.

(Ilvy Njiokiktjien/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nFueling the appetite for sustainable fuel\\n\\nIn 2023, a Boeing 777 flew across the Atlantic Ocean burning fuel made from nothing but waste fat and sugar. The flight was a first, but it was really a publicity stunt — carrying Virgin Atlantic bigwigs, not paying passengers. The fuel is too expensive, and too scarce, for that to make business sense.\\n\\nInstead, Neste blends its french fry fuel with standard kerosene made from crude oil before delivering it to airports.\\n\\nSAF is almost identical to standard jet fuel, and it releases just as much CO2 when it’s burned. But experts say there’s a key difference: Drilling for oil takes carbon that was locked away underground and releases it into the atmosphere. Making fuel from used cooking oil and tallow takes carbon that was already circulating through the air and the bodies of plants and animals and recycles it. No new carbon moves from underground storage into the atmosphere.\\n\\nSample vials at Neste. (Ilvy Njiokiktjien/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nSite director Hanna van Luijk at Neste. (Ilvy Njiokiktjien/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nIt takes energy to collect and transport used cooking oil, rearrange fat molecules into jet fuel and get that fuel to planes. But, overall, making and burning SAF adds as much as 80 percent less carbon to the atmosphere as making and burning fossil fuel from crude oil.\\n\\nBecause there isn’t enough waste oil in the world to satisfy the airline industry’s thirst, companies are developing other ways to make low-carbon jet fuel. One option is to grow more crops like soy that can be crushed for oil and turned into jet fuel — although that raises the risk that more land will be cleared for farming in fragile ecosystems like the Brazilian Amazon. Environmentalists have raised similar concerns about raising more corn, sugar cane or beets to create ethanol and convert it into kerosene.\\n\\n“The problem with crop-based biofuels is it takes land to produce them at a time when we’re already expanding cropland … which means more deforestation, and the carbon losses are far greater than the potential savings from reducing fossil fuel use,” said Tim Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton’s Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment.\\n\\nStory continues below advertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAlternately, farmers could grow more cover crops on their fields between their regular planting seasons, which would create a new source of plant oils or ethanol without using extra land. Some companies have experimented with turning trash into jet fuel, but the most prominent player went bankrupt last year. Others are splitting water molecules to harvest their hydrogen and combining it with captured carbon to make fuel.\\n\\nExperts say it will take a combination of all these methods to make enough green fuel to power the world’s planes.\\n\\nHowell, of Mahoney Environmental, collects used cooking oil behind Umai Nori. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe one thing all alternative fuel recipes have in common is that they are more expensive than fossil fuel — and experts say they always will be. Making SAF from waste oil is “locked in at a cost which is about two times the cost of fossil jet, and it’s going to be entirely reliant on subsidies,” according to Pavlenko. The other methods could be even more expensive, even after they’ve had time to raise production and lower costs.\\n\\nThe future of the industry will depend on whether the United States keeps tax credits in place and the European Union stands by its green fuel mandates. Neste is expanding its Rotterdam refinery in anticipation of stricter E.U. blending rules, and in the United States, the first large-scale SAF operations started pumping out fuel in recent years in response to new tax credits that have since been weakened.\\n\\nBack at Le Diplomate, amid the evening dinner rush, frites flow out of the kitchen to feed hungry diners who are unwittingly helping launch planes into the sky with every bite.\\n\\ncorrection\\n\\nIn a previous version of this article, a photo caption gave an incorrect name and title of a man working in the laboratory at Neste.

Both US and European biofuel policies increasingly favor non-food-based feedstocks, positioning UCO prominently within efforts to reduce fuel-pool carbon intensity and dependency on agricultural commodities. \\n\\nThe UCO supply chain begins locally at restaurants, hotels, and food processors, where specialized recyclers collect and transport waste oil to facilities that clean and refine it into SAF and other biofuels. Yet, surging SAF demand has reshaped global supply flows: the United States, once a net exporter, became a net importer of UCO after 2021 to meet rising domestic consumption driven by aviation-sector sustainability targets.\\n\\nAs supply chains globalize, American SAF producers have increasingly relied on international sources, notably China, to bridge emerging feedstock gaps. However, this dependency amplifies exposure to geopolitical risks, notably disruptions due to escalating trade tensions. The ongoing US-China trade war, along with policy frictions such as the early-2025 imposition of a 10% tariff on Canadian biofuels (excluding SAF), has rattled investor confidence and highlighted the vulnerability of cross-border UCO flows. These uncertainties underline the critical importance of accurate forecasting and strategic planning to mitigate supply risks and sustain stable feedstock access for SAF production.\\n\\nIn June 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) introduced a final rule that will reduce RIN (Renewable Identification Number) generation for biofuels produced with imported feedstocks as of October 1, 2025\\\\. This rule marks a turning point for the SAF and renewable diesel industries, reshaping sourcing strategies, cost structures, and investment priorities.\\n\\nFor those trading in the biofuels and feedstocks market, we capture pricing across the complex marketplace, including biodiesel, glycerin, renewable identification numbers (RINs), California’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits and related certificate markets in Europe. Learn more.\\n\\nDemand–supply dynamics\\n\\nStrong policy support for biofuels derived from low-carbon feedstocks has substantially elevated UCO’s strategic value. Policies promoting renewable fuels increasingly emphasize feedstocks with lower carbon intensity profiles over traditional, food-based oils. Consequently, US demand for UCO has soared, driven by policies incentivizing renewable diesel and other biofuel production. Fastmarkets estimates total UCO usage in the US in 2024 at 8.4 billion pounds, an increase of 42% over the year, underscoring the importance of supportive regulatory frameworks in accelerating demand for sustainable feedstocks.\\n\\nHowever, UCO collection infrastructure struggles to match soaring demand. Fastmarkets estimates UCO collection to be at 3.3 billion pounds in 2024, which is insufficient to meet the US biofuel industry’s demand for 5.7 billion pounds of feedstock in the year. The Biden Administration’s ambitious SAF targets of 3 billion gallons by 2030 amplify concerns about potential feedstock shortages.\\n\\nChina has become the dominant supplier of US UCO for biofuel production. In 2024, the US imported approximately 2.8 billion pounds of UCO from China, making it by far the most significant external source of this key low-carbon feedstock. This dependence exposes the US biofuels sector to significant geopolitical risk. Trade tensions, such as the imposition of high US tariffs on Chinese UCO, or broader diplomatic frictions, could abruptly disrupt supply flows.\\n\\nAdditionally, early-2025 guidance on Section 45Z (the Clean Fuel Production Credit) disqualified imported feedstocks—including Chinese UCO—from generating tax credits under the program. With UCO imports ineligible for 45Z credits, the incentive to source foreign oils weakened, contributing to a sharp plunge in US import volumes in April 2025.\\n\\nReplacing China as a supplier is not a simple task. While countries like Canada, Malaysia, and members of the European Union also export UCO to the US, the scale is significantly smaller. In 2024, Canada exported around 613 million pounds, while all EU member states combined accounted for just over 440 million pounds. Malaysia and the United Kingdom contributed 335 million and 221 million pounds, respectively. These figures pale in comparison to China’s 2.8 billion pounds. Building alternative supply chains of this magnitude would require years of investment in UCO collection infrastructure and trade logistics. With limited global availability and rising demand, few suppliers can match China’s volume and cost efficiency in the near term, putting other low-ci feedstocks on the table as substitutes. Replacing Chinese UCO in the context of the current Trade War depends not only on UCO availability, but also the suppliers’ diplomatic relations with the US.\\n\\nAmong low-carbon-intensity feedstocks, UCO stands out as the only one with significant potential for scalable supply growth. Unlike tallow or other animal fats, which are byproducts limited by livestock production and thus structurally constrained, no one raises cattle to produce tallow; its availability is capped by meat demand. In contrast, UCO production is a function of how much UCO collecting infrastructure there is\\\\[MC1\\\\] .\\n\\nGlobal UCO supply is expected to grow in the following years, fueled by strong policy incentives and increasing demand from SAF and renewable diesel producers. This growth is expected to come from improved collection efficiency, the formalization of previously untapped sources, and investments by biofuel producers integrating upstream into the waste oil value chain. Companies like Neste have already moved to secure feedstock through acquisitions and partnerships with collectors, recognizing UCO’s central role in SAF economics.\\n\\nStill, even with ambitious growth projections, global UCO volumes may fall short of meeting total biofuel demand. That’s why stakeholders must treat UCO as both a strategic opportunity and a bottleneck risk, optimizing its use while developing complementary feedstocks. The coming years will favor players who move early to secure scalable low-CI feedstock supply, and UCO is the most viable path forward in that race.\\n\\n UCO price dynamics and forecast\\n\\nFastmarkets’ price assessment of UCO in the US Gulf has shown a strong upward trend since 2020, reflecting tightening supply and rising demand from renewable fuel producers. In early 2020, prices hovered in the mid-20 cents per pound range. By late 2022, they had moved into the mid-30s, and by the end of 2023, prices consistently reached the 40s. In 2024, this trend accelerated further, with prices climbing above 50 cents per pound by the end of the year and remaining elevated through early 2025\\\\. This sustained price strength highlights the combination of expanding SAF production capacity, robust policy incentives for low-carbon fuels, and limited availability of alternative low-CI feedstocks.\\n\\nVolatility was a defining feature of the UCO market in both 2024 and early 2025\\\\. Monthly spreads between the highest and lowest reported prices regularly exceeded 8 cents per pound, with some months approaching a 14-cent range. These sharp swings reflect a market that is highly sensitive to shifts in policy, trade disruptions, and speculative movements. In 2024, for instance, fluctuations in Chinese export volumes, investigations into UCO origin verification\\\\[MC2\\\\] , and shifting expectations around SAF tax credits all contributed to abrupt pricing changes. In 2025, the continuation of this volatility has been fueled by ongoing uncertainty about the future of biofuel policy in the US, including the potential revision of SAF tax credits\\\\[MC3\\\\] , and geopolitical friction affecting UCO trade flows.\\n\\nLooking ahead, Fastmarkets forecasts prices for the rest of 2025 to remain in the low to mid-50s cents per pound range\\\\[MC4\\\\] , with a brief dip projected mid-year before a gradual recovery into early 2026\\\\. However, these forecasts are highly sensitive to policy direction and trade conditions. If the proposed changes to the 45Z credit are approved, allowing crop-based oilseed feedstocks to generate credits on par with low-CI alternatives, it could significantly reduce demand for low-CI feedstocks in the US, potentially putting downward pressure on UCO prices in the coming year.\\n\\nIn this context, price volatility is likely to persist, and stakeholders across the SAF value chain will need to closely monitor political developments and maintain flexible procurement and pricing strategies to manage feedstock risk effectively.\\n\\nUCO global market outlook and strategic implications\\n\\nThe evolving policy environment, industry commitments to decarbonization, and competition for feedstocks are reshaping the UCO market landscape. Government mandates and sustainability targets have effectively created a stable demand floor for UCO-based renewable fuels. However, inherent limits on UCO availability mean that the market faces structural constraints, necessitating strategic diversification of feedstocks and intensified investment in alternative technologies.\\n\\nSAF producers and aviation stakeholders must increasingly treat UCO as a strategic resource, securing stable supplies through long-term agreements, vertical integration, and partnerships. They should also engage proactively with policy development to foster supportive frameworks. Additionally, exploring complementary feedstocks and innovative technologies will be essential for long-term viability.\\n\\n Conclusion\\n\\nUCO has transitioned from a simple waste byproduct to a critical component of the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts. The next few years will further highlight the strategic importance and inherent challenges of relying on UCO. Supply constraints, logistical complexities, price volatility, and evolving sustainability standards are significant factors that industry stakeholders must manage effectively.\\n\\nAccurate forecasting and strategic planning will be crucial for navigating this complex landscape. Fastmarkets’ market insights and price forecasts offer essential tools for stakeholders, providing clarity on emerging supply bottlenecks, pricing trends, and regulatory impacts. Utilizing such data enables airlines and biofuel producers to make informed procurement and investment decisions, optimizing their strategies to secure cost-effective and sustainable SAF supplies.\\n\\nGiven these dynamics, stakeholders should actively leverage comprehensive market intelligence and strategic foresight to ensure a robust and resilient SAF supply chain. UCO’s central role in the aviation industry’s sustainability journey underscores the need for careful resource management, proactive risk mitigation, and strategic innovation to maintain momentum toward a cleaner aviation future.\\n\\n Free agriculture market webinars \\n\\nReceive monthly agriculture commodity insight videos\\n\\n Sign up \\n\\nGet started\\n\\n SAF in 2025: pioneering EU and UK aviation fuel mandates \\n\\nDiscover the key insights, forecasts, and industry dynamics shaping the future of aviation fuel and learn how these mandates will impact the global landscape.\\n\\n Access our data report \\n\\nTrusted by over 14,000 global customers\\n\\nGet started \\n\\n The Jacobsen is part of Fastmarkets \\n\\n Learn more \\n\\nWhat to read next\\n\\n Global pet food and animal feed markets: navigating volatility and building resilience \\n\\n This article explores the macro trends shaping the animal feed and pet food industry, the specific risks threatening your supply chain, and why accessing reliable market intelligence is the single most important factor in building long-term resilience. \\n\\n January 27, 2026 \\n\\n · \\n\\n By Fastmarket team \\n\\n European biofuel feedstock prices fluctuate significantly in 2025, market expects more volatility next year: 2026 preview \\n\\n Prices for European biofuel feedstocks from the Annex IX A and B list, including animal fats, used cooking oil (UCO) and soap stock acid oil (SSAO), showed a wide range of volatility during 2025, according to Fastmarkets’ assessments, with levels fluctuating by $152.50 per tonne (16.5%) on average. \\n\\n January 26, 2026 \\n\\n · \\n\\n By Veronika Prykhodko \\n\\n Correction to US hide index, assessments on January 21 \\n\\n The following prices have been corrected: AG-CH-0082 Hide index, fob US, $/pc was published incorrectly at $13.8875 per piece.

While extensive research has been conducted on binary fuel blends (e.g., biodiesel-diesel), studies exploring the combined effect of three fuels i.e. biodiesel (from waste cooking oil), a higher alcohol (pentanol), and diesel is less common. This study investigates the potential benefits of using this specific combination in a diesel engine, with the goal of improving combustion and reducing emissions. A key focus of the study is identifying the optimal concentration of Al2O3 nanoparticles to achieve maximum performance and emission reduction in the ternary blend. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with ASTM standards. Biodiesel was produced through the transesterification process, and the sample blends were prepared accordingly. The fuel properties of the blends were found to be within the recommended limits. The samples were evaluated in a 4-stroke, constant-speed, DI diesel engine. An optimization analysis of the experimental results was performed using Taguchi/Grey relational analysis to determine the best combination of blend ratios and operating conditions. The most effective combination for butanol-based ternary blends was Bu10B30D60 with 50 ppm of nano-additive at 50% engine load. Similarly, for pentanol-based ternary blends (Pe10B30D60), the optimal condition was with 50 ppm of nano-additive at 100% load, while for propanol-based blends (Pr10B30D60), the optimal condition was at 0% load with the same nanoparticle concentration. According to the findings, ternary blends containing pentanol and waste cooking oil biodiesel demonstrated significantly better performance and lower emissions compared to the other blends.\\n\\n Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\nAnalysis of a CRDI diesel engine powered by ternary fuel blends (diesel, biodiesel, and pentanol) doped with alumina nano-additives \\n\\nArticle Open access 14 July 2024 \\n\\n Enhancing diesel engine efficiency with waste cooking oil biodiesel and nano additives for sustainable fuel applications \\n\\nArticle Open access 28 August 2025 \\n\\nMachine learning and response surface optimization to enhance diesel engine performance using milk scum biodiesel with alumina nanoparticles \\n\\nArticle Open access 01 October 2025 \\n\\n Introduction\\n\\nCurrent compression ignition (CI) engines operate on liquid fuels, which are primarily derived from crude oil. Crude oil is refined to produce diesel, a commonly used liquid fuel. However, due to the growing demand for fossil fuels, the depletion of oil reserves, and increasingly stringent pollution regulations, researchers are showing increased interest in alternative fuels. One such alternative is biodiesel, which is produced from plant and animal fats. Biodiesel consists of long-chain alkyl esters derived from these fats. It is commonly produced through a process known as transesterification, in which vegetable oils or animal fats chemically react with an alcohol to produce biodiesel. When methanol is used as the alcohol, the resulting product is fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) the most common form of biodiesel. Although ethanol can also be used, methanol is preferred due to its lower cost.\\n\\nBiodiesel can be made from both edible and non-edible plant oils such as soybean oil1.\\\"), jatropha oil2 and Tyre Pyrolysis Oil (TPO) blends. Fuel 108, 699–708. \\n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2012.12.042\\n\\n (2013).\\\"),3.\\\"), rubber seed oil4, palm oil5.\\\"), mango seed oil6.\\\"), mahua oil7.\\\"),8.\\\"), cottonseed oil9.\\\"), lignocellulosic materials10.\\\"), canola oil11.\\\"), linseed oil12.\\\"), algae oil13.\\\"), industrial waste oil14.\\\"), corn oil15.\\\"), olive oil 16.\\\"), wheat starch17.\\\"), and cassava18.\\\"). Numerous studies have already been conducted on the performance of biodiesel derived from these sources. In addition to being a viable fuel for CI engines, biodiesel is also a low-carbon substitute for heating oil. It offers several advantages, including higher cetane numbers and excellent lubricity, which helps extend the lifespan of high-pressure diesel injection systems and reduces wear in the fuel system. Biodiesel contains no sulfur and is often blended with ultra-low sulfur diesel to enhance lubricity. Biodiesel is biodegradable and emits fewer pollutants without releasing toxic substances. Biodiesel blends can be used in existing CI engines with little or no modification. As the volumetric concentration of biodiesel increases, Sauter mean diameter (SMD) values also rise. These values are directly influenced by the thermophysical properties of the fuel 19.\\\"). Because biodiesel has higher viscosity and surface tension than conventional diesel, biodiesel-diesel blends exhibit larger SMD values. Nevertheless, the fuel spray penetration of these blends remains comparable to that of pure diesel20.\\\").\\n\\nWaste cooking oils (WCOs) are advantageous second-generation biodiesel feedstocks that can be utilized as a sustainable energy source21.\\\"). The staggering volume of WCOs generated worldwide has led to significant societal, economic, and environmental concerns. It is estimated that approximately 15 million tonnes of WCOs are produced globally each year22.\\\"),23. A large portion of WCOs consists of triglycerides, monoglycerides, and diglycerides. Additionally, free fatty acids (FFAs) are present, typically ranging from 5 to 20% by weight. Triglycerides, composed of both unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, are commonly used as base chemicals in various industries to produce high-value products24.\\\").\\n\\nBiodiesel derived from waste cooking oil is currently being explored as an attractive alternative fuel due to its low emissions, biodegradability, non-toxic nature, and near-zero carbon footprint25.\\\"). In recent years, this type of biodiesel has gained significant popularity. However, there are certain drawbacks associated with the long-term use of WCO biodiesel, including reduced thermal efficiency, carbon deposits on valves, and scuffing of piston rings in engines26 doped with alumina nano-additives. Sci Rep 2024;14:16228.\\\"). One of the most important concerns is the stability of biodiesel, especially when produced from used cooking oil. A major issue is the high viscosity of WCO biodiesel, which negatively affects atomization and pumping properties when used in CI engines. To mitigate these disadvantages, the viscosity of clean biodiesel should be reduced as much as possible. One study found that using zinc oxide nanoparticles combined with tungsten phosphoric acid as a catalyst can reduce peroxide levels and increase the stability of used cooking oil biodiesel blends27.\\\"). This type of solid acid catalyst (SAC) used in the transesterification process also has a minor influence on fuel properties. Additionally, the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of WCO biodiesel blends was found to be higher than that of conventional diesel blends. Calcium oxide (CaO) nanoparticles, when synthesized and used as additives, also appear to be a promising option for enhancing the combustion properties of engines running on WCO biodiesel blends28.\\\").\\n\\nHowever, one disadvantage of using esters is their high viscosity, which leads to various challenges, including cold starting. To address this issue, alcohol fuels such as ethanol and butanol can be added to biodiesel-diesel blends to improve their overall fuel properties. This addition helps increase engine performance and combustion efficiency, while simultaneously reducing harmful pollutants like smoke and particulates29.\\\"). Given the growing concerns about alcohol-based biofuels and biodiesel, an alternative and expanded approach to mixing alcohol with both diesel and biodiesel is being actively explored. This strategy may alleviate some of the current concerns associated with biodiesel, as high-alcohol pentanol has been shown to improve fuel quality30.\\\"). Owing to the its superior fuel properties, high-alcohol pentanol could potentially mitigate some of the recent challenges faced in biodiesel fuel usage. At lower percentages, alcohols can be blended with diesel fuel. Due to their higher latent heat of vaporization and lower net calorific value, alcohols are commonly used in blends. Additionally, because alcohols promote low-temperature combustion, their incorporation into base gasoline significantly reduces NOx emissions31.\\\").\\n\\nLower C-H chain alcohols, such as ethanol and methanol, have been used in several studies as blended fuels; however, this often leads to phase separation and poor ignition characteristics32 mode. Fuel 170, 49–59 (2016).\\\"). Alcohols with longer C-H chains and comparatively higher calorific values, such as butanol, pentanol, and octanol, are potential additives to diesel–biodiesel blends to mitigate these issues. Several studies have shown that adding these higher C-H alcohols to diesel helps reduce CO and NOx emissions. Alcohols with more than 4 carbon atoms (up to 10 carbon atoms) are considered higher alcohols, which are typically more viscous and oily. Alcohols with more than 12 carbon atoms are solid at room temperature. Alcohols such as butanol, pentanol, propanol, and octanol, which have longer C-H chains and higher calorific values, can be added to diesel and biodiesel to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. However, certain stabilizers are required to homogenize diesel-alcohol and biodiesel-alcohol mixtures. These stabilizers are relatively expensive, which increases the overall fuel cost. To address this, several studies have been conducted to eliminate the need for stabilizers, leading to the development of ternary blends.\\n\\nWhen 10–15% biodiesel is added to diesel-alcohol blends, phase stratification is reduced, creating a novel fuel blend known as the ternary fuel blend33.\\\"). This approach results in a fuel that is less expensive than conventional diesel. Therefore, a ternary fuel mixture of diesel, alcohol, and biodiesel could serve as a viable alternative fuel for current diesel engines. The use of a ternary mixture of waste cooking oil biodiesel, higher alcohols, and diesel in CI engines has been rarely explored.\\n\\nNano-additives are widely used to investigate the effects of biodiesel–diesel blends on ignition delay (ID) and combustion34.\\\") 35.\\\"). When nano-additives are added to fuels like gasoline or diesel, they act as viscosity reducers, enhancing combustion activity. Metal oxide nanoparticles can also promote secondary atomization processes, thereby improve thermal efficiency and reduce emissions36.\\\"). The combination of biodiesel and nano-additive leads to enhanced combustion quality, which in turn increases the engine’s thermal efficiency. When added to fuel, these metal-based nanoparticles exhibit a natural catalytic effect on hydrocarbon combustion reducing ID and soot ignition temperature while increasing the energy density of the fuel blend. Recently, a variety of nano-additives have been explored to enhance engine performance. However, the optimal concentration of nano-additives required to improve performance and minimize emissions in diesel engines remains unclear37.\\\"). Therefore, it is essential to identify the ideal ratio of nano-additives in relation to engine parameters, without compromising performance or emissions. Taguchi method has been recognized as an effective strategy for multi-objective optimization, including engine development. Nonetheless, limited research has explored the effects of blend concentration and nanoparticle dosage as independent variables to achieve optimal engine performance and minimal emissions38 2 and CaO nanostructures. J. Exp. Nanosci. 5, 93–105 (2010).\\\").\\n\\nBased on insights from the literature, the current research focuses on analyzing the potential use of a ternary blend in a CI engine. This study aims to improve engine performance and reduce emissions by utilizing ternary blends of WCO biodiesel, alcohol, and diesel, supplemented with Al2O3 nanoparticles, as fuel in a direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The primary objective of this research is to examine how these ternary blends, in combination with nanoparticles, influence emissions, combustion characteristics, and engine performance. The study addresses a significant research gap, the lack of comprehensive investigation into the specific combination of alcohol, Al2O3 nanoparticles, and WCO biodiesel in diesel engines. Key contributions of this research include assessing the feasibility of these blends as sustainable alternatives to conventional diesel, and identifying the optimal blend ratios that enhance engine performance while minimizing emissions. This study highlights the potential of WCO biodiesel–alcohol–diesel blends as a competitive and environmentally friendly substitute for fossil diesel. It also provides guidance on ideal blend ratios to improve performance and reduce harmful exhaust emissions. Additionally, the study offers valuable insights into the role of Al2O3 nanoparticles in enhancing combustion and reducing emissions. Ultimately, it underscores the viability of using waste cooking oil as a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production, thereby supporting circular economy initiatives.\\n\\nThe key merits of this research lie in its focus on sustainability, the exploration of novel fuel blend combinations, and the potential for improved engine performance. While the study specifically investigates a diesel engine, the findings may be applicable to a wide variety of diesel-powered vehicles. However, the study also has certain limitations. Additionally, the research acknowledges that biodiesel blends can lead to increased NOx emissions, highlighting the need for further investigation and the development of effective mitigation strategies. Moreover, long-term studies are necessary to assess the durability and reliability of engines running on these blends. The use of biodiesel can sometimes result in issues such as carbon deposits or piston ring scuffing, which may affect engine longevity. To reduce dependence on fossil fuels, this study demonstrates that WCO biodiesel–alcohol–diesel blends have strong potential as competitive alternatives to conventional diesel fuel. It offers recommendations for optimal blend ratios that enhance engine performance while reducing harmful emissions. Furthermore, the research provides insights into how Al2O3 nanoparticles can further improve combustion efficiency and emissions control. Finally, it emphasizes the potential of using waste cooking oil as a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel production, thereby supporting circular economy initiatives.\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nThe methodology adopted for achieving the envisaged objective is presented in Fig. 1. The test rig consists of a four stroke, vertical, single cylinder, air cooled, DI diesel engine which is basically used for stationery applications. It is a kind of engine that can handle wide variety of viscous fuels.\\n\\nFig. 1\\n\\nResearch methodology.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nCommon rail direct injection (CRDI) is a cutting-edge technique that delivers highly pressured fuel to injectors through a common rail. As the name suggests, it is a direct injection system, meaning that fuel is sprayed straight into the cylinders by the injectors. Some previous results have shown that CRDI technology could combust better with diesel. This engine is attached with sequence of instruments to bring out the results with variable loads from 0 to 100% at intervals of 25%. Figure 2 shows how the experimentation setup is laid out. Table 1 lists the test engine specs used for the experiments.\\n\\nFig. 2\\n\\nArrangement of test rig.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nTable 1 Engine Specifications.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\n Biodiesel production\\n\\nCleaned waste cooking oils were collected from the kitchen of Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, where the oil is used for frying various food items. Initially, the FFA content of the oil samples was measured, followed by the transesterification process. Sodium hydroxide pellets (caustic soda) were used as a catalyst. Methanol was mixed with dry sodium hydroxide pellets to dissolve them. A solution of 180 ml of methanol and 3.75 g of NaOH pellets was thoroughly stirred for 30 min. This mixture of alcohol and catalyst was then added to the oil in a conical flask. A magnetic stirrer, running at 300 rpm, was used to mix the fluid evenly for two and a half hours at a constant reaction temperature of 60 °C. Initially, the catalyst reacts with the FFA in the oil, forming soap. The presence of water and free fatty acids in the oil can lead to the formation of emulsions with methanol or oil, which may hinder the reaction. These emulsions were discarded. After the reaction was completed and the alcohol was removed, the solution was left to settle for 24 h, allowing the methyl ester and glycerin layers to separate completely. Due to the difference in density, glycerin, being denser, settled at the bottom and was drained off, leaving the methyl esters (biodiesel) as the upper layer. The transesterification process is shown in Fig. 3.\\n\\nFig. 3\\n\\nTransesterified waste cooking oil.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nThe esters are stored after the glycerine has been extracted and they have been washed with warm water to remove the leftover residues. A flask separator was used to extract the methyl esters from sedimentation. The biodiesel was washed with 10% water until it reached the desired purity. Following this, it was dried using a dryer and then placed under an electric fan for 12 h to ensure complete drying. The control factors of the biodiesel production process are presented in Table 2.\\n\\nTable 2 Transesterification parameters.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\nPreparation of nano alumina\\n\\nThe solution gelation method, which entailed dissolving the sample of 25 g of aluminium nitrate in the citric acid with 0.5 as the molar ratio, was used to create alumina nanoparticles. With continuous stirring and heated at 80 °C the solution is gelled. After being dried for 10 h at 90 °C, the gel was melted at 1055 °C to produce a white powder as shown in Fig. 4. Figure 5 displays the X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Al2O3. Diffraction peaks of Al2O3 at 2θ values are 33°, 38°, 52°, 64°, 68°, 78°. It confirmed that the Al2O3 powder has cubic phases and agreed by the file No. 46–1212 of standard JCPDS-ICDD. Table 3 shows the lattice parameters of the produced Al2O3 nano powder particles derived from the XRD pattern39.\\\").\\n\\nFig. 4\\n\\nAl2O3 nano powder.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 5\\n\\nXRD spectrum of Al2O3 nano powder.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nTable 3 Lattice parameters for the Al2O3 nano powder.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\n Blend preparation and fuel properties\\n\\nThe sonicating method is used to combine biodiesel-diesel with alcohol. Hielscher brand ultrasonic mixing reactor was used for blending alchols with biodiesel and diesel. In this investigation, a bioruptor system consisting of a water bath and high-powered ultrasound generators beneath the tank was employed. The Bioruptor and probe sonicator generate ultrasonic radiation at the same frequency (20 kHz). When a metallic bar comes into and touches the sample, it assists to transmit the ultrasonic waves into the tubes. This metallic patented resonance bar reflects ultrasound from the bath, increasing the sonication efficiency. After the biodiesel is mixed with diesel and alcohol, it is placed in the ultrasonicator and agitated for 30 to 45 min to produce a homogeneous blend.\\n\\nThree types of blends with biodiesel and diesel were prepared from each alcohol. Table 4 gives the acronym and constituents of the prepared blends for this study. The biodiesel samples are tested for fuel properties as per the ASTM standards and shown in Table 5. The characteristics reveal that the manufactured fuel samples fall within the ASTM standards, and these fuels may be used to power a CI engine. All these blends were tested in engine without and with 25ppm and 50ppm of nano additive additions.\\n\\nTable 4 Fuel samples prepared and studied in the study.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\nTable 5 Properties of fuel samples.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\nResults and discussion\\n\\nA detailed experimental investigation on ternary fuel blends of WCO biodiesel blends has been made and the results are furnished in this section. For comparison purpose, pure diesel was also tested for the same conditions and inferences made on comparative analysis are reported. The performance & combustion characteristics and emission results are depicted through graphs and are compared on the basis of blend concentration, Nano additive concentration and engine loading. Table 6 summarizes the performance results of the tested samples.\\n\\nTable 6 Performance characteristics of the blends.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\n Brake thermal efficiency\\n\\nThe ratio of engine brake power to the heat input is known as its BTE. Fuel characteristics such as density and heating value have significant impact on the BTE. The Figs. 6, 7 and 8 shows the variations of BTE values against the engine load for the D100, Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60, Pr10B30D60 without nano particle addition and with 25ppm and 50ppm nano particle additions respectively.\\n\\nFig. 6\\n\\nBrake thermal efficiency of the blends without nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 7\\n\\nBrake thermal efficiency of the blends with 50ppm Al2O3.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 8\\n\\nBrake thermal efficiency of the blends with 25ppm Al2O3.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nThe BTE values in Table 6 demonstrate that; the diesel has greater thermal efficiency values. Its high calorific value is the reason for this. As the biodiesel concentration in the blends increases, so do the BTE curves for the blends. Out of all the higher alcohol ternary lends tested, n-pentanol ternary fuel blends outperformed compared to all other tested blends40.\\\"),41.\\\"),42.\\\"). The mean BTE values of all the blends were increased by 4% when 50ppm of Al2O3 nano additives are added average at all tested loads. The mean BTE value increases by a very less amount of 0.3% when 25ppm of Al2O3 nano additives are added average for all tested loads. It turns out that the performance of blends is not significantly affected by the 25ppm of nano additive addition. This shows out of the three types of blends tested, the 50ppm nano additive added blends show enhanced BTE values for all the blends43.\\\"). The BTE values for the diesel and the ternary mixtures increase with increase in engine load and reaches a maximum at 75% load and after that finds a drop. At lower load condition, straight diesel achieved greater efficiency values than the blends at all three injection pressures.\\n\\nBrake specific energy consumption\\n\\nBrake specific fuel consumption (BSEC) is known as the amount of fuel utilized per unit power developed per unit time. It primarily depends on the properties of the fuel, particularly its heating value. However, the BSEC is calculated based on the density of the fuel only. For comparing different fuel types with different calorific values, brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) values are appropriate. The Figs. 9, 10 and 11 show the variations of BSEC values against engine load for the straight D100, Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without and with 50ppm and 25ppm Al2O3 nano particles. As the biodiesel concentration in the blend is more, the BSEC value for each biofuel mixture increases steadily. Of all the tested blends, the pentanol ternary biodiesel blends Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60 and Pe10B30D60 produced less BSEC values44.\\\"),[45](/articles/s41598-025-26974-2ref-CR45 \\\"Park, S.

Energy 99, 334–343. \\n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.05.050\\n\\n (2012).\\\"). The results revealed that BSEC values for all the blends were decreased by 0.35% on average when 50ppm of Al2O3 nano additives at all loads. The average BSEC value decreases by 0.15–0.2% when 25ppm of Al2O3 nano additives are added at all loads. It turns out that the BSEC value of the blends is not significantly affected by the addition of nano additive addition. It also revealed that, the 50ppm nano additive added blends show favorable BSEC values for all the blends46.\\\").\\n\\nFig. 9\\n\\nBSEC values of the blends without nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 10\\n\\nBSEC values of the blends with 50ppm of Al2O3.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 11\\n\\nBSEC values of the blends with 25ppm of Al2O3.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nEffect of load: The energy consumption is decreased with increase in engine load for all the tested blends. At higher loads of the engine, the energy consumed is almost the same for all the blend types. At lower loads, always more fuel is consumed with or without nano-additive additions. Changing the loads impacts BSEC values greatly. The full load condition of the engine decreased the BSEC values by at least 20% on average for all the fuel types, either with nano additives or without.\\n\\nExhaust gas temperature\\n\\nOne of the output factors that quantifies how much heat is lost is the engine’s exhaust gas temperature (EGT). The EGT values of D100, Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without and with 50ppm and 25ppm Al2O3 nano particles are depicted in Figs. 12, 13 and 14 respectively.\\n\\nFig. 12\\n\\nExhaust Gas Temperature of the blends without nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 13\\n\\nExhaust Gas Temperature of the blends with 50ppm of Al2O3.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 14\\n\\nExhaust Gas Temperature of blends with 25ppm of Al2O3.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nUnder all circumstances, blends of biofuel have produced higher EGT values than pure diesel. If the biodiesel concentration in the blend rose, the EGT value for each biofuel blend decrease steadily. On comparing the blends, pentanol ternary biodiesel blends Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60 and Pe10B30D60 produced lesser EGT values followed by butanol ternary biofuel blends. The results revealed that nano additive definitely boosted the EGT values. The EGT values for all the blends were increased by 5 to 6% on average when 50ppm of Al2O3 nano additives at all loads. The average EGT value increases approximately by 1.5% when 25ppm of Al2O3 nano additives are added at all loads. It turns out that the EGT value is affected slightly by the inclusion of nano additive addition. nano additive added blends would have increased the combustion temperature in turn results increase in EGT for all the blends. High cylinder temperature during the combustion causes more heat transfer from the cylinder walls which in turn rises the EGT values. As the load increases, the EGT values for both diesel and biodiesel blend raised. The full load state in this study showed greater EGT values for all blends because larger loads result in higher combustion temperatures. As the load rises, extra fuel is pumped into the cylinder, raising the EGT to maintain the same power output. The fuel’s oxygen concentration enhances combustion, raising the EGT. The increased ID and intrinsic oxygen content are the causes of the greater combustion temperature.\\n\\n Heat release rate\\n\\nHeat release rate (HRR) is known as the amount of heat spawned during combustion in the engine cylinder. This heat is utilized for shaft work and to heat the working medium, increasing its internal energy. Some portion of the heat is lost with the cooling water through cylinder walls as well as cylinder heads. The Figs. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 shows the variations of heat release rate in kJ/m3deg against crank angle (°CA) for Diesel, Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive addition and with 50ppm and 25ppm Al2O3 addition at zero load, half load and full load respectively. The biodiesel blends and pure diesel show rapid premixed combustion trailed by the diffused combustion. Fast burning of the pre-mixed blend, followed by fast heat release and dispersed combustion, occur shortly after the delay time. The combustion rate is determined by the available flammable air–fuel combination. The pre-mixed combustion for the biodiesel blends is extremely quick, according to the study’s heat release rate curves. For pure diesel without nano additive addition, the peak HRR value is 19.9 kJ/m3 occurred at 3°bTDC for zero load condition, 44.12 kJ/m3 occurred at 5°bTDC for half load condition and 40.28 kJ/m3 occurred at 6°bTDC for Full load condition. Whereas for the biofuel blends Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive addition the peak HRR are 18.48, 22, 20.48, 18.42, 18.75, 18.29, 18.4, 13.93 and 13.05 kJ/m3 occurred at 6°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 6°bTDC, 3°bTDC, 3°bTDC, 1°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 8°bTDC, and 5°bTDC respectively for zero load condition. 40.89, 43.69, 42.62, 43.05, 43.46, 38.35, 43.28, 38.33 and 35.12 kJ/m3 occurred at 4°bTDC, 9°bTDC, 9°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 1°bTDC, 3°bTDC, and 5°bTDC respectively for Half load condition.\\n\\nFig. 15\\n\\nHRR of blends without nano additive for zero load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 16\\n\\nHRR of blends without nano additive for full load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 17\\n\\nHRR of blends without nano additive for half load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 18\\n\\nHRR of blends with 50ppm nano additive for zero load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 19\\n\\nHRR of blends with 50ppm nano additive for full load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 20\\n\\nHRR of blends with 50ppm nano additive for half load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 21\\n\\nHRR of blends with 25ppm nano additive for zero load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 22\\n\\nHRR of blends with 25ppm nano additive for full load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 23\\n\\nHRR of blends with 25ppm nano additive for half load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFor pure diesel with 50ppm nano additive addition, the peak HRR value is 22.885 kJ/m3 occurred at 3°bTDC for zero load condition, 55.15 kJ/m3 occurred at 6°bTDC for full load condition and 54.25 kJ/m3 occurred at 6°bTDC for half load condition. 14.925 kJ/m3 occurred at 3°bTDC for zero load condition, 38.505 kJ/m3 occurred at 5°bTDC for full load condition and 37.2 kJ/m3 occurred at 6°bTDC for half load condition for the pure diesel with 25ppm nano additive addition. Whereas for the biofuel blends Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 with 50 ppm nano additive addition the peak HRR are 21.252, 25.3, 23.552, 21.183, 21.5625, 21.0335, 21.16, 16.0195, 15.0075 kJ/m3 occurred at 5°bTDC, 4°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 3°bTDC, 1°bTDC, 1°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 7°bTDC, and 4°bTDC respectively for zero load condition. 51.1125, 54.6125, 53.275, 53.8125, 54.325, 47.9375, 54.1, 47.9125, 43.9 kJ/m3 occurred at 3°bTDC, 6°bTDC, 8°bTDC, 3°bTDC, 3°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 1°bTDC, 2°bTDC, and 3°bTDC respectively for half load condition. 82.809, 62.0865, 61.776, 51.2595, 68.4855, 90.666, 54.837, 48.7485 and 68.715 kJ/m3 occurred at 4°bTDC, 7°bTDC, 8°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 4°bTDC, 4°bTDC, 8°bTDC, and 9°bTDC respectively for full load condition respectively. 13.86, 16.5, 15.36, 13.815, 14.0625, 13.7175, 13.8, 10.4475 and 9.7875 kJ/m3 occurred at 5°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 5 bTDC, 2°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 2° bTDC, 6°bTDC, and 6°bTDC respectively for zero load condition. 34.7565, 37.1365, 36.227, 36.5925, 36.941, 32.5975, 36.788, 32.5805 and 29.852 kJ/m3 occurred at 3°bTDC, 6°bTDC, 7°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 2°bTDC, 2°bTDC, and 3°bTDC respectively for half load condition. 58.273, 43.6905, 43.472, 36.0715, 48.1935, 63.802, 38.589, 34.3045, 48.355 kJ/m3 occurred at 5°bTDC, 9°bTDC, 9°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 5°bTDC, 3°bTDC, 5° bTDC, 9°bTDC, and 9°bTDC respectively for full load condition respectively for the same blends with 25 ppm nano additive additions47. For all fuel sources, the heat release rate rises with increasing load. More growth of combustion temperature and pressure is ascribed to higher loads48.\\\"). When the load is increased from zero load to half load the average increase in peak pressure of each blend is approximately 125 to 150% and from half load to full engine load the increase is 50–75%.\\n\\nCylinder pressure\\n\\nFigures 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 depicts the cylinder pressures against crank angle for the diesel, Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive additions and with 50ppm and 25ppm Al2O3 nano additive additions respectively for zero load, half load and full conditions respectively. The peak pressure produced through fuel combustion, when chemical energy is transformed into pressure energy, is known as the engine’s peak cylinder pressure. Both engine power and emissions will be impacted by this. The pentanol ternary fuel blends produced all of the greatest peak pressures occur. Because the delay period is shortened when bio-oil is utilized, yet pressure development is lessened due to poor diffusion, the propanol ternary blends recorded relatively lower peak pressure values.\\n\\nFig. 24.\\n\\nCylinder pressure of the blends without nano additive for Zero Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 25.\\n\\nCylinder pressure of the blends without nano additive for Half Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 26\\n\\nCylinder pressure of the blends without nano additive for Full Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 27\\n\\nCylinder pressure of blends with 50ppm of Al2O3 for Zero Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 28\\n\\nCylinder pressure of blends with 50ppm of Al2O3 for Half Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 29\\n\\nCylinder pressure of blends with 50ppm of Al2O3 for Full Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 30\\n\\nCylinder pressure of blends with 25ppm of Al2O3 for Zero Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 31\\n\\nCylinder pressure of blends with 25ppm of Al2O3 for Half Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 32\\n\\nCylinder pressure of blends with 25ppm of Al2O3 for Full Load.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFor pure diesel without nano additive addition, the peak pressure value is 50.65 bar occurred at 6° aTDC for Zero load condition, 66.19 bar occurred at 6°bTDC for half load condition and 74.28 bar occurred at 6°aTDC for Full load condition. Whereas for the biofuel blends Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive addition the peak pressure values are 48.34, 54.35, 53.98, 50.18, 49.35, 48.2, 45.61, 52.07, 51.68 bar occurred at 6° aTDC, 6° aTDC, 7° aTDC, 3° aTDC, 2° aTDC, 2° aTDC,2° aTDC, 8° aTDC, and 6° aTDC respectively for zero load condition. 64.88, 67.51, 67.16, 65.96, 65.88, 64.3, 60.33, 67.79 and 68.1625 bar occurred at 3° aTDC, 8° aTDC, 9° aTDC, 5° aTDC, 5° aTDC, 2° aTDC, 1° aTDC, 3° aTDC, and 5° aTDC respectively for Half load condition. 78.89, 73.33, 74.27, 75.23, 76.52, 81.46, 70.46, 76.41, 78.98 bar occurred at 5° bTDC, 5° aTDC, 5° aTDC, 6° aTDC, 6° aTDC, 4° aTDC, 5° aTDC, 6° aTDC, and 6° aTDC respectively for full load condition respectively. It can be revealed from the results that, every greatest peak pressure measured by various fuel types happened for the blends with more biodiesel content. Also, the peak cylinder pressure rises as the biodiesel concentration does. This is because an increase in biodiesel concentration raises the charge’s starting temperature and pressure, which in turn raises the cylinder pressure. Blends with a lower proportion of biodiesel have less efficient combustion with smaller rise in pressure because combustion starts a bit later. The residual combustion will continue throughout the expansion stroke.\\n\\nFor pure diesel with 50ppm nano additive addition, the peak pressure value is 52.85 bar occurred at 3° aTDC for zero load condition, 83.25 bar occurred at 6° aTDC for full load condition and 94.25 bar occurred at 6° aTDC for half load condition. 14.925 bar occurred at 3° aTDC for zero load condition, 38.505 bar occurred at 5° aTDC for full load condition and bar deg occurred at 6° aTDC for half load condition for the pure diesel with 25ppm nano additive addition.

The maximum peak pressure recorded by individual fuel blends in the study occurred at full load. More growth of combustion temperature and pressure is ascribed to higher loads50.\\\"). Complete combustion is ensured when the ignition lag shortens when the load rises. Shortly after TDC, the biodiesel types examined in the study under all circumstances reached their maximal pressure levels.\\n\\n Ignition delay\\n\\nThe Figs. 33, 34 and 35 show the variations of ID in deg crank angle for the diesel and different blends such as Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive additions and with 50 ppm & 25 ppm nano additive additions at various engine loads respectively. Upon increasing the engine load the ID declines for all the tested fuel blends. Since biodiesel has a higher cetane number than diesel, which resulted shorter ID when used in CRDI engines with ternary blends of diesel, biodiesel, and higher alcohol[51](/articles/s41598-025-26974-2#ref-CR51 \\\"Sharma A, Murugan S.

The presence of pentanol, butanol, and propanol increased viscosity, impede atomization, and prolong ignition, whereas the addition of oxygenates promotes more complete combustion. By enhancing heat conductivity and promoting fuel evaporation and fuel–air mixing, Al2O3 nanoparticles shortens the ID in fuels. Although NOx emissions may somewhat rise, their large surface area also encourages more effective combustion and heat release, improving engine performance and lowering harmful emissions 53.\\\").\\n\\nFig. 33\\n\\nIgnition delay of blends without nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 34\\n\\nIgnition delay of blends with 50ppm nano additive addition.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 35\\n\\nIgnition delay of blends with 25ppm nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nNitrogen oxides\\n\\nNitrogen oxide (NOX) generation in CI engines is caused by a longer retention period and a higher flame temperature54. Compared to diesel, the biodiesel blends have a higher oxygen content[55](/articles/s41598-025-26974-2ref-CR55 \\\"Sharma, A. & Murugan, S. Effect of blending waste tyre derived fuel on oxidation stability of biodiesel and performance and emission studies of a diesel engine. Appl. Therm.

The Figs. 36, 37, 38 show the variations of NOX emissions in ppm against engine load for the straight diesel, blends Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive additions and with 50ppm & 25 ppm nano additive additions at various engine loads respectively. Table 7 summarizes the emission results of the tested samples.\\n\\nFig. 36\\n\\nNitrogen oxides of blends without nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 37\\n\\nNitrogen oxides of blends with 50ppm nano additive addition.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 38\\n\\nNitrogen oxides of blends with 25ppm nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nTable 7 Emission characteristics of the blends.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\nUnder all circumstances, blends of biofuel have produced more NOx values than pure diesel. If the biodiesel concentration in the blend rose, the NOx value for each biofuel blend decrease steadily. The pentanol ternary biodiesel blends Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60 and Pe10B30D60 produced higher EGT values followed by butanol ternary biofuel blends. By comparing all the fuel blends, the pentanol blends produced greater NOX values. When the pressure and temperature is high almost all the injected fuel is burnt which leads to boosting up of peak cylinder temperature which in turn produces more NOX emissions. The trend is reversed for the other blends, i.e. the combustion will take place in power stroke which results in less peak temperature56.\\\"). The NOX emissions steadily rise in tandem with the load. The NOX emissions are lower at the initial load circumstances. Greater combustion temperatures brought on by further load increases result in noticeably greater NOX readings57.\\\").\\n\\nCarbon monoxides\\n\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is produced during the transitional phases of the oxidation of fuel. The interaction between the CO and the oxidants in the cylinder causes the oxidation from CO to CO2. The CO won’t be fully oxidized if there are insufficient oxidants, a low gas temperature, or a brief retention period. Carbon monoxide may be produced from extreme mixture ratios. The Figs. 39, 40, 41 show the CO emissions against the engine load for the straight diesel, Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive addition, with 50ppm and 25 ppm Al2O3 nano additive addition at various engine loads, respectively. In comparison to pure diesel, with greater oxygen content, which encourages better oxidation, led to somewhat reduced CO emissions for the blends. However, the biofuel blends Bu20B20D60, Pr20B20D60, and Pr15B25D60 occasionally showed superior CO emissions particularly at lower load conditions. Their poor spray formation properties, which result from the lesser calorific values, are the source of the rise in CO. In contrast, the mixes Pe20B20D60, Pr10B30D60, and Pe10B30D60 generated reduced CO emissions due to their complete combustion and high oxygen concentration in biodiesel.\\n\\nFig. 39\\n\\nCarbon oxide emissions of blends without nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 40\\n\\nCarbon monoxide emissions of the blends with 50ppm nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 41\\n\\nCarbon monoxide emissions of the blends with 25ppm nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFor all fuel types, the addition of nano additives marginally has produced lesser CO emissions as compared to blends without nano additives. The CO emissions were lower because the nano additives increased the fuel surface for combustion by breaking the heavy biodiesel molecules allowed for adequate space and time for full combustion. The blends without nano additive addition managed to produce slightly higher CO emissions[58](/articles/s41598-025-26974-2ref-CR58 \\\"Shaafi, T. & Velraj, R. Influence of alumina nanoparticles, ethanol and isopropanol blend as additive with diesel-soybean biodiesel blend fuel: Combustion, engine performance and emissions. Renew Energy 80, 655–663. \\n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2015.02.042\\n\\n (2015).\\\"). The CO emission progressively rises as the load does59.\\\"). There is not much of a difference in CO emissions between the tested at lower loads.\\n\\nSmoke opacity\\n\\nOne kind of emission particle that is created when fuels are deposited on the walls of the cylinder is smoke60.\\\"). The Figs. 42, 43, 44 show the smoke opacity values against load for the straight diesel, Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive addition, with 50ppm and 25 ppm Al2O3 nano additive addition at various engine loads, respectively. The smoke opacity ratings of the biofuel blends were greater than that of diesel. This is because blends of alcohol and biodiesel have heavy molecules, low volatility, and high viscosity. Because biofuel blends are poorly atomized, it is witnessed that the smoke values rises as the biodiesel concentration rises. Because of their light viscosity, the pentanol ternary blends burn better than their counterparts, resulting in somewhat lower smoke opacity ratings. It is learned that, the 50ppm nano additive addition recorded less the smoke opacity than the 25ppm addition. The complete combustion is realized in pentanol blends because of effective atomization, causing less smoke formation for these fuel types61.\\\"). The complete combustion could reduce the smoke formation for all the fuel types62.\\\"). The smoke opacity steadily increases as the load does63.\\\"). For every fuel type examined, the variations in the blends’ values at lower loads are minimal.\\n\\nFig. 42\\n\\nSmoke Opacity of blends without nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 43\\n\\nSmoke Opacity of blends with 50ppm nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 44\\n\\nSmoke Opacity of blends with 25 ppm nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\n Unburnt hydrocarbons\\n\\nHeterogeneous combustion is a feature of CI engine. Fuel evaporation and air–fuel mixing with unburned gases occur at the same time61.\\\"). The generation of unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) pollutants from this type of combustion is a complicated topic to examine. The generation of UHC during combustion is caused by very rich and lean mixes64.\\\"). Hydrocarbon emission, which quantifies the total amount of unburned hydrocarbon, can be used to demonstrate how complete a combustion process is. Biodiesel with a higher cetane number ignites faster and operates more efficiently, reducing hydrocarbon emissions65.\\\"). The slow mixing of ternary blends with air results in an over-rich mixture or quenching of the combustion reaction, and this can result in incomplete combustion products and high UHC in the exhaust gases. Incomplete combustion products and excess UHC in exhaust gases may result from an over-rich mixture or the quenching of the combustion reaction induced by the slow mixing of ternary mixes with air. The Figs. 45, 46, 47 show the HC emissions against load for the Diesel, Bu20B20D60, Bu15B25D60, Bu10B30D60, Pe20B20D60, Pe15B25D60, Pe10B30D60, Pr20B20D60, Pr15B25D60 and Pr10B30D60 without nano additive addition, with 50ppm and 25 ppm Al2O3 nano additive addition at various engine loads, respectively.\\n\\nFig. 45\\n\\nUnburnt hydrocarbons of blends without nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 46\\n\\nUnburnt hydrocarbons of blends with 50ppm of nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFig. 47\\n\\nUnburnt hydrocarbons of blends with 25ppm nano additive.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nWhen compared to diesel, the biodiesel blends show varying levels of UHC emissions. The ternary blends from butanol and propanol occasionally had higher UHC readings. These biodiesel kinds with higher viscosity and density characteristics have lower UHC emissions. Because of their high oxygen concentration and low viscosity, the pentanol ternary blends have somewhat lower UHC values than the other blends. The blends’ UHC values fall as the amount of biodiesel rises. The UHC emission levels drop when the nano additive level in the blends is increased. By providing adequate space and time for full combustion, the increased injection pressure after adding the nano additives lowers the generation of UHC. Because it takes less time for full combustion for the blends without nano additives, the tendency is reversed. When the load increase, UHC emission also increases for all the tested fuels. But there is no much rise in the UHC emission values from Zero load to Maximum load condition. It demonstrates that load fluctuation has very little effect on the production of UHC. There will be fewer hydrocarbon emissions at higher flame temperatures. Since biodiesel has high oxygen concentration, it combusts more competently and releases less hydrocarbons. In the case of biodiesel mixes, it guarantees full combustion. These findings are consistent with some past studies66,67.\\\"). According to some studies, biodiesel alcohol blends greatly reduce UHC emissions and smoke26 doped with alumina nano-additives. Sci Rep 2024;14:16228.\\\"). Compared to those studies, the current study uses a higher percentage of alcohol (low cetane number) and biodiesel (increased viscosity), which comprises larger molecules. The evaporation rate slows as the droplet size grows due to the biodiesel’s high viscosity. Higher HC and smoke generation resulted from an increase in ID induced by alcohols’ lower cetane number. A reduced evaporation rate might lead to an over-rich mixture or quench the combustion reaction, resulting in incomplete combustion products, HC, and smoke in the exhaust gases68.\\\").\\n\\nGrey relational analysis\\n\\nSeveral strategies were employed to sort the relationship between multiple variables. One of those is the Grey relational method. The Taguchi method, which is based on Grey relational analysis, can be utilized to address multi-response problems69.\\\"),70. This method is used to optimize the concentration of the ternary blend in percentage of volume, the concentration of the Al2O3 nano additive, and the load percentage71.\\\"). The Grey relationship coefficients are calculated and the experimental results are standardized. These factors offer the connection between appropriate and actual values. The coefficients were then averaged to define grade values for the three process answers. The overall analysis of the several trial data is originated from the calculated Grey relational grades. The process for calculating the Grey grade relationship value is explained in the phases that follow.\\n\\nInitially, the S/N ratio (Yij) was calculated from the original experimental data. The parameters brake thermal efficiency and cylinder pressure are set as greater the better-quality attributes since the parameters that result from the output need to be maximized. Equation (1) is used to get the S/N ratios for these values.\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\frac{{\\\\\\\\text{S}}}{{\\\\\\\\text{N}}}{\\\\\\\\text{Ratio}} = - 10{\\\\\\\\text{log }}\\\\\\\\left( {\\\\\\\\frac{1}{{\\\\\\\\text{n}}}} \\\\\\\\right)\\\\\\\\mathop \\\\\\\\sum \\\\\\\\limits\\\\_{k = 0}^{n} 1/{\\\\\\\\text{Y}}^{2}$$\\n\\n (1)\\n\\nIt is necessary to limit the emission values, brake specific energy, HRR and EGT and to be set as the lower the better values. Equation (2) is used to get the S/N ratios from these values.\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\frac{{\\\\\\\\text{S}}}{{\\\\\\\\text{N}}}{\\\\\\\\text{ratio}} = - 10{\\\\\\\\text{log }}\\\\\\\\left( {\\\\\\\\frac{1}{{\\\\\\\\text{n}}}} \\\\\\\\right)\\\\\\\\mathop \\\\\\\\sum \\\\\\\\limits\\\\_{k = 0}^{n} {\\\\\\\\text{y}}^{2}$$\\n\\n (2)\\n\\nNext, the parameters’ normalized values are computed. A normalization is done to scale the single input into an appropriate range and distribute it uniformly. The Eq. (3) is used to calculate these normalized values through transformation.\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\text{xi }( (\\\\\\\\text{k})=\\\\\\\\frac{yi \\\\\\\\left(k\\\\\\\\right)+\\\\\\\\text{min}yi (k)}{\\\\\\\\text{maxyi }\\\\\\\\left(\\\\\\\\text{k}\\\\\\\\right)-\\\\\\\\text{minyi }(\\\\\\\\text{k})}\\\\\\\\text{Yi}2$$\\n\\n (3)\\n\\nThe normalized lower the better values are calculated by using the Eq. (4)\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\text{xi }( (\\\\\\\\text{k})=\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\text{maxyi}\\\\\\\\left(\\\\\\\\text{k}\\\\\\\\right)-\\\\\\\\text{yi }(\\\\\\\\text{k})}{\\\\\\\\text{maxyi }\\\\\\\\left(\\\\\\\\text{k}\\\\\\\\right)-\\\\\\\\text{minyi }(\\\\\\\\text{k})}$$\\n\\n (4)\\n\\nEq. (5) was used to calculate the values of the Grey relational coefficients, or GCij. Equation (6) was used to determine the Grey relational grades (Gi) from the averaged Grey relational coefficients\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\text{GC} =\\\\\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\Delta \\\\\\\\text{min}+ \\\\\\\\lambda \\\\\\\\Delta max}{\\\\\\\\Delta \\\\\\\\mathit{ij} \\\\\\\\left(\\\\\\\\text{k}\\\\\\\\right)- \\\\\\\\lambda \\\\\\\\Delta max}$$\\n\\n (3.5)\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\text{Gi}= \\\\\\\\frac{1}{\\\\\\\\text{m}}{\\\\\\\\sum }\\\\_{k=1}^{n}( \\\\\\\\text{GC})$$\\n\\n (3.6)\\n\\nwhere;\\n\\nS/N-signal to noise ratio\\n\\nYi-engine output parameter\\n\\nXi-normalized value\\n\\nGC-Grey relational coefficient\\n\\nGi-Grey relational grade\\n\\nMin-minimum\\n\\nMax-maximum\\n\\nThe Experimental values, S/N ratios, Normalized S/N ratios, ∆s, Grey relational coefficients and Grey relational grades of Butanol, pentanol and propanol-based ternary lends are included in the Appendices section after being tallied. The optimal levels of the single-response Grey grade Gi problem are studied through analysis.\\nThe major effects of the butanol blends are shown in Table 8. the Taguchi’s Grey grade relational analysis found the optimum combination for the butanol blends as Bu10B30D60, 50% load, 50 ppm Al2O3 from the experimental values.\\nThe major effects of the butanol blends are shown in Table 9. The optimum combination for the pentanol blends was found as Pe10B30D60, 100% load, 50 ppm Al2O3 from the experimental values.\\nThe major effects of the butanol blends are shown in Table 10. The optimum combination for the propanol blends was found as Pr10B30D60, 0% load, 50 ppm Al2O3 from the experimental values.\\n\\nTable 8 Optimized combination for Pentanol Blends.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\nTable 9 Optimized combination for Butanol blends.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\nTable 10 Optimized combination for Propanol blends.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\n Conclusions\\n\\nAs per the experimental studies made on the diesel engine with the ternary blends of butanol, pentanol and propanol with waste cooking oil biodiesel and straight diesel with and without nano particle addition loading the following conclusions are made:\\n\\nThe addition Al2O3 nano additive concentration 50 ppm with the ternary blends improved the brake thermal efficiency values of 4% average for all the fuels tested. The brake specific energy consumption values for the ternary blends are higher than the straight diesel with or without nano additive addition. The specific energy consumption decrease slightly for all the fuel used when the nano additives are added.\\nAddition of 50 ppm of Al2O3 nano additives enhanced the heat release rate whereas the heat release rate is lesser when the blends are combusted without nano additives considerably. By comparing the ternary blends, it is clear that pentanol ternary blends had the maximum peak pressures. Due to the higher cetane number of biodiesel compared to diesel, the ignition delay was shorter for all blends.\\nCompared to straight diesel, the biofuel ternary blends in this study recorded high NOX values since the biodiesel blends contains more oxygen content. The ternary blends recorded slightly less CO emissions due to the rich oxygen content which leads to complete oxidation. All the ternary blends recorded higher smoke opacity values. When biodiesel content increases in the blends the smoke opacity also increased. Butanol and propanol recorded higher UHC values.\\nAs per the optimization study, the optimum combination found for all the alcohol ternary blends\\n\\nScope for future work\\n\\nIn summary, future research should focus on tackling the present difficulties of NOx emissions of biodiesel operation and nanoparticle durability, while improving mixture concentration and engine operating conditions to get the most out of this potential renewable fuel combination. Varying engine loads and speeds, Injection timing and pressure, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and Combustion chamber geometry are some of the engine operating conditions can be taken for these fuel samples. The research may be expanded to use quaternary biodiesel mixes in a diesel engine with several cylinders. The chemistry of combustion and atomization may be examined using simulation techniques (CFD). It is possible to assess a simulation process for the performance and combustion of ternary and quaternary biofuel blends in a CI engine. Nanoparticles have the ability to wear down the precise tolerances and critical dimensions of injector orifices and pintels, altering spray patterns and injection timing while also influencing emissions and combustion. To avoid issues like settling and agglomeration, the long-term stability of nanoparticle-enhanced biofuels in storage and use must be thoroughly evaluated.\\n\\n Data availability\\n\\nThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\nBTC:\\n\\nBottom dead centre\\n\\nBP:\\n\\nBrake power\\n\\nBSFC:\\n\\nBrake specific fuel consumption\\n\\nBTE:\\n\\nBrake thermal efficiency\\n\\nCO2 :\\n\\nCarbon di oxide\\n\\nCO:\\n\\nCarbon monoxide\\n\\nCI:\\n\\nCompression ignition\\n\\nCuO:\\n\\nCopper oxide\\n\\nCA:\\n\\nCrank angle\\n\\nCP:\\n\\nCylinder pressure\\n\\nDI:\\n\\nDirect injection\\n\\nECA:\\n\\nElectro chemical activated cell\\n\\nEGR:\\n\\nExhaust gas recirculation\\n\\nEGT:\\n\\nExhaust gas temperature\\n\\nFFA:\\n\\nFree fatty acid\\n\\nHRR:\\n\\nHeat release rate\\n\\nHC:\\n\\nHydro carbon\\n\\nID:\\n\\nIgnition delay\\n\\nIP:\\n\\nInjection pressure\\n\\nMT:\\n\\nMetric tonnes\\n\\nNP:\\n\\nNanoparticle\\n\\nNOx:\\n\\nNitric oxide\\n\\nPM:\\n\\nParticulate matter\\n\\nppm:\\n\\nParts per million\\n\\nKOH:\\n\\nPotassium hydroxide\\n\\nNaOH:\\n\\nSodium hydroxide\\n\\nTDC:\\n\\nTop dead centre\\n\\nUHC:\\n\\nUn burnt hydro carbon\\n\\nVCR:\\n\\nVariable compression ratio\\n\\n References\\n\\nRajak, U. et al.

Yet the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law requiring the use of biofuels in transport, remains stuck in an era when biofuels seemed like the only option to reduce transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The latest proposal from EPA doubles down on this outdated vision. It would raise food and fuel costs for consumers by increasing the amount of biomass-based diesel (BBD) mandated under the program without delivering meaningful GHG emission benefits. \\n\\nEPA’s proposal increases renewable volume obligations (RVOs), the mandatory volumes that specify how much biofuel must be supplied. It also halves the compliance value of imported fuel or fuel produced from imported feedstocks by reducing the generation of renewable identification numbers (RINs)—credits used for compliance with renewable fuel blending mandates. For every gallon of biofuel produced from imported feedstock, twice as much fuel must be supplied to meet RFS obligations. Fuels like biodiesel produced from imported used cooking oil now generate half the compliance value of a domestic fuel, such as soy-derived biodiesel.\\n\\nEPA justifies these changes by emphasizing the economic and energy security benefits of domestic feedstocks. However, overall U.S. consumption of fats and oils for fuel and other purposes such as cooking and animal feed already exceeds total domestic production. Instead of supporting domestic feedstock producers, the proposal would increase U.S. reliance on imported fats and oils.\\n\\nThe figure below shows how growing imports have supported U.S. BBD consumption. In 2019, domestic fat and oil production met 84% of demand. By 2024, this had fallen to 68%. The gap was filled by more imports of vegetable oil, fat oil, and grease. The United States turned from a net exporter of 0.6 million tonnes in 2019 to a net importer of 3.1 million tonnes in 2024.\\n\\nFigure 1. U.S. fats and oil supplies, 2019 and 2024\\n\\nEPA’s proposal would only accelerate this trend, increasing reliance on imported fats, oils, and greases rather than wind them down. The next figure compares EPA’s projection of the 2027 BBD volumes needed to meet the current proposal with expected domestic fat and oil production and non-fuel consumption. Our projections assume the full utilization of soybean crushing capacity projected by the industry, representing a best-case scenario for domestic vegetable oil supply.\\n\\nFigure 2. U.S. fats and oil supply and use in 2027 under current proposal\\n\\nAs illustrated by the figure, U.S. fat and oil imports would dramatically increase under the proposal; net vegetable oil imports are projected to surge by around 5 million tonnes (from 6.1 to 11.0 MMT). Greater demand for vegetable oil will increase its price, likely around 12% based on a previous analysis of the relationship between biodiesel demand and global vegetable oil prices. \\n\\nHowever, a more dramatic price spike is possible. As described in EPA’s Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment, the 2020–2022 vegetable oil price shock that increased global prices from $700 to $1,800 per metric ton was likely caused by biofuel-driven demand and weather-related supply disruptions. The projected 5 million tonne net increase in U.S. vegetable oil imports is equivalent to 6% of the current global vegetable oil trade, creating a risk of short-term price spikes as global oilseed production responds to the additional demand.\\n\\nAccording to EPA analysis, this huge increase in BBD consumption will not even meaningfully reduce U.S. GHG emissions, with savings equivalent to less than 1% of road sector emissions at best. One EPA model even suggests that the use of crop-based BBD fuels would increase GHGs. This is perhaps unsurprising, as current growth in vegetable oil production is concentrated in Brazil and Indonesia, where agricultural expansion often relies on high carbon-stock forested land. Indeed, groundbreaking work from Chen et al. has found that that global demand for BBD between 2002 and 2018 drove the conversion of approximately 1.7 million hectares of forest to oil palm. This means continued market-mediated oil crop expansion could very well offset any emissions reductions from additional BBD use in the United States.\\n\\nFinally, the proposal’s claims of energy security benefits are unconvincing. Will energy security really be improved by replacing a domestic energy source (petroleum) with one we have to import? And while EPA assumes that the United States will remain the preferred destination for BBD feedstocks globally, this isn’t guaranteed. Changing policies in China have dramatically reduced used cooking oil exports to the United States, and sustainable aviation fuel mandates in the European Union and United Kingdom will heighten competition for feedstock.\\n\\nOverall, EPA projects its current proposal will saddle consumers with $6.8 billion in extra fuel costs and $2.4 billion in higher food prices each year, all without meaningful emissions cuts or improved U.S. energy independence. Twenty years in, we need a wholesale reconsideration of the Renewable Fuel Standard— the inconsistencies of EPA’s proposal show exactly why reform is needed.\\n\\n Author\\n\\nAndy Navarrete \\nResearcher\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\nHow has the Renewable Fuel Standard impacted food and feed prices?\\n\\nPrint\\n\\nSectorFuels\\n\\nRegionUnited StatesUnited States & Canada\\n\\n Related Content\\n\\nVideo \\n\\nHow has the Renewable Fuel Standard impacted food and feed prices?\\n\\nMarch 10, 2021\\n\\nJoin our mailing list to keep up with ICCT’s latest research and analysis.\\n\\nTwitter\\nYouTube\\nLinkedIn\\nBluesky\\n\\nContact Us \\n\\n© 2026 International Council on Clean Transportation.

However, biodiesel’s economic feasibility for mass-production remains a challenge. This study investigates the use of cement kiln dust (CKD) waste as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of a mixed oil made from unrefined palm oil and waste cooking oil (WCO) to increase the cost-effectiveness. To enhance the activity of the CKD, it was treated at optimized conditions of 850 °C for 2 h. The optimal blend (60 wt% WCO) for transesterification using CKD was determined through a comparative analysis of different ratios.

Experiments were carried out on a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine under varying load conditions. Among the tested blends, the B20 + TiO2 (25 ppm) mixture exhibited a modest reduction in brake thermal efficiency (2.53%) and a slight increase in brake specific energy consumption (3.80%) compared to diesel fuel. However, significant emission improvements were achieved, with a reduction in CO (23.42%) and HC (24.78%) emissions, accompanied by a decrease in smoke opacity (12.37%). The findings highlight that TiO2 nano-additive biodiesel blends offer a sustainable and environmentally viable alternative to conventional diesel. The study is constrained by its emphasis on a particular mixture of biodiesel and nano additives, perhaps limiting the generalisability to different combinations or concentrations. The study largely assesses engine performance and emissions under a singular operating condition, potentially neglecting differences in performance across varied loads or speeds.\\n\\n Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\nEffect of different configurations of hybrid nano additives blended with biodiesel on CI engine performance and emissions \\n\\nArticle Open access 22 August 2024 \\n\\n Emission and performance analysis of diesel engine running with CeO2 nanoparticle additive blended into castor oil biodiesel as a substitute fuel \\n\\nArticle Open access 01 April 2024 \\n\\nAnalysis of the pooled effect of compression ratio and injection timing variation on conventional diesel engine powered with nano doped biodiesel blend \\n\\nArticle Open access 01 July 2025 \\n\\n Introduction\\n\\nCurrently, more than one billion people lack access to reliable energy, which limits socio-economic development and highlights the global demand for sustainable, low-emission fuels as alternatives to fossil energy sources. The scientific scene of today emphasises a great need for inventions including lower emissions and modern technologies meant to eradicate world greenhouse gas emissions. The research findings illustrate a sharp increase in energy-related pollutant emissions projected to reach a peak in the near future. Furthermore, the findings indicate a significant demand for low-emission products and advancements in technology aimed at reducing greenhouse gas pollutant emissions. This event occurred as a result of the increasing anticipation and momentum to swiftly shift towards energy systems that incorporate renewable energy sources. Moreover, a significant gap has emerged between the ongoing discomfort and the oil retail markets, potentially linked to climate and geopolitical uncertainties[1](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR1 \\\"Agarwal, S., Kumari, S., Mudgal, A. & Khan, S.

By conducting a thorough analysis of quaternary fuel blends, the team is able to ascertain the optimal fuel proportions, the resulting effects, and the inherent chemical and physical properties of the blend. This review deepens the understanding of the subject matter. Furthermore, the assessments of nano additives contribute to understanding the pollutant emissions from the diesel engine. The incorporation of nano additives with biodiesel and quaternary fuels has led to a reduction in pollutant emissions from diesel engines. This assessment reveals the relevance, stability, properties, and utilisation of the nano additives, ultimately concluding with the suitable percentage of these additives. This process aims to enhance the performance of the diesel engine and improve combustion characteristics through the utilisation of these fuel types2, 230005. \\n https://doi.org/10.4491/eer.2023.005\\n\\n (2024).\\\").\\n\\nThe utilisation of petroleum diesel fuel derived from fossil fuels faces two significant challenges: the first challenge is a scarcity of available sources, and the second challenge is the detrimental impact on the natural environment. Biodiesel has garnered considerable acclaim as an environmentally friendly fuel and has become one of the leading alternatives to traditional petroleum-based diesel. Biodiesel is generated through the fermentation of vegetable oils, as opposed to the combustion of fossil fuels. The generation of biodiesel, which can be derived from animal fats, used cooking oil, and oil extracted from microalgae, necessitates the incorporation of long-chain fatty acids as a fundamental input material. It comes from both consumable and non-consumable sources, including rapeseed oil, coconut oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, groundnut oil, and palm oil. Examples of non-edible oil resources include mahua, castor, cotton, rubber, animal tallow, neem, jatropha, and jojoba. Additional examples encompass mahua, sunflower oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, palm oil, coconut oil, and groundnut oil, all of which serve as sources of edible oils[3](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR3 \\\"Bouguessa, R., Tarabet, L., Loubar, K., Belmrabet, T. & Tazerout, M.

Moreover, diesel engines find extensive application in commercial settings, including on-road vehicles within the transportation sector and off-road vehicles utilised in agriculture and mining. This is attributed to their superior energy transfer capabilities and their status as one of the most economical power sources available. Biodiesel presents significant benefits compared to other renewable sources; however, it also comes with notable drawbacks, including its higher density and viscosity, which can lead to injector choke and reduced engine longevity. Transesterification is regarded as the simplest method for transforming triglycerides into methyl ester. Additionally, as an unexpected outcome of the transesterification process, there is a reduction in the viscosity of vegetable oil. Consequently, alterations need to be implemented to both the fuel and the engine to attain the necessary improvements in engine characteristics[4](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR4 \\\"Atmanli, A. & Yilmaz, N.

These additives are available in various forms and can be utilised alongside diesel and biodiesel[6](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR6 \\\"Verma, P., Sharma, M. P. & Dwivedi, G.

This innovative catalyst system is designed to improve the efficiency, reusability, and environmental friendliness of the transesterification process used in biodiesel production. The incorporation of metal additives, alcohols, cold flow improvers, and cetane improvers into biodiesel enhances its physicochemical properties, increases the combustion rate, and diminishes the emissions produced by diesel engines.\\n\\nThe objective of the investigation carried out evaluate the impact of integrating biodiesel with nano catalysts or nano additives on the performance characteristics of diesel engines. The properties of the mixture, such as its pour point, fire point, flash point, and viscosity, were significantly enhanced as a direct result of this. The manufacturing process of nano catalysts involves the use of ceramics and various types of metal oxides, including iron-metal oxides, aluminium-metal oxides, titanium-metal oxides, and carbon-metal oxides. A variety of studies have supported the incorporation of organic manganese additives like copper and aluminium, which could enhance an engine’s combustion characteristics, as well as its torque and braking power output, while potentially decreasing exhaust emissions[7](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR7 \\\"Hawi, M., Elwardany, A., Ismail, M. & Ahmed, M.

The findings indicate that the integration of diesel nanoparticles with biodiesel enhances the brake thermal efficiency by 2%, while also decreasing the fuel consumption by up to 7%. Moreover, the incorporation of biodiesel and diesel nanoparticles resulted in a reduction of CO emissions by 25% in comparison to traditional diesel, along with a 26% decrease in UBHC emissions. The nanoparticles facilitated both of these reductions. Conversely, the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from the biodiesel-diesel-metal addition was 25.32% higher than that produced by standard diesel.\\n\\nThis study aims to enhance our understanding of the impact of methyl ester-CNT (Carbon Nanotubes) mixtures on the performance parameters of diesel engines. The findings indicated that the application of biodiesel blends led to a decrease in UBHC, CO, and soot concentrations in engine exhaust; nonetheless, there was an observed increase in NO emissions[9](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR9 \\\"Senthilkumar, R., Manieniyan, V., Sukumar, S. & Sivaprakasam Analysis on DI diesel engine with combined multi-walled carbon nanotubes and vegetable oil refinery waste as biodiesel.

The findings indicate that the brake power of B20 and B40 blends is lower, whereas the specific fuel consumption is higher in comparison to diesel. This occurred even though the B20 and B40 blends exhibited a greater specific fuel consumption. The findings indicated a decrease in UBHC and CO emissions; however, there was a slight rise in NOx emissions. The presence of oxygen in biodiesel contributed to enhancing the efficiency of the combustion process, leading to a subsequent rise in NO emission generation. Using nano additives in conjunction with biodiesel and quaternary fuels, the current research highlights the significant reduction in the emissions of pollutants that are produced by diesel engines. According to other research, which primarily concentrated on the advantages of biodiesel as a whole and did not particularly include nano additives, this is not consistent with the findings. Although similar tendencies were observed in earlier studies, there was not a thorough investigation into the trade-offs.\\n\\nA series of tests to investigate the performance and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine to determine the impact of blending biodiesel with diesel emulsion fuels. Applying emulsion fuel containing up to 1% span 80 and various emulsion fuel mix combinations allowed us to examine the combustion and emission traits of diesel engine[11](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR11 \\\"Akram, S. et al.

The comparison was conducted with conventional diesel fuel. Both nitrogen oxides and particulate matter were drastically cut down by using an emulsified blend of biodiesel and gasoline. This study examined the performance and emission characteristics of biodiesel made from waste cooking oil in diesel engines that were combined with nano additives of cerium, zinc, and titanium oxide.\\n\\nAddition of zinc oxide (ZnO) to biodiesel acts as a catalyst and it reduces the time and temperature required for complete combustion and thereby decreases the ignition delay which results in the increase in cetane number. Cerium oxide (CeO2) has the ability to store and release oxygen. When cerium oxide is mixed with biodiesel and heated, it releases oxygen. Increase in oxygen amount facilitates quick and complete combustion. This increases the fuel efficiency. It also helps to reduce the harmful emission of carbon monoxide and smoke. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles act as a catalyst and it increases the speed of oxidation and it helps in complete combustion. They can increase the heat released during combustion and hence it can increase the efficiency of the engine12 leaves and investigation of their usability as alternative fuel additives for diesel-safflower oil biodiesel blends, fuel, 367,( 131498.

This approach is novel because it identifies as a sustainable alternative for conventional diesel fuel: enhanced with nanoparticles, biodiesel generated from waste cooking oil. The work integrates ultrasonic insertion of nano additives (cerium, zinc, and titanium oxide), transesterification with a lipase-enhanced nano catalyst. The study presents an absolute evaluation of performance, emission of an engine with B20 fuel and TiO2 nano additive and conclusively positively identifies the outcomes as sustainable fuel alternative for conventional fossil fuel in a prime mover.\\n\\nUsing waste cooking oil biodiesel mixed with nano-additives (cerium, zinc, and titanium oxide) by ultrasonic treatment seeks to improve diesel engine efficiency. According to the theory, these combinations will lower hazardous emissions and increase engine performance relative to standard diesel. The effects of these combinations on brake thermal efficiency, brake specific energy consumption, and emissions at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm are assessed in this work. Supporting their possible use as a sustainable fuel alternative, results demonstrate that the B20 + TiO2 mix displays encouraging decreases in unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and smoke emissions.\\n\\nAlthough numerous studies have explored the integration of nano additives in biodiesel to improve engine performance and reduce emissions, the present study distinguishes itself through several innovative aspects. The use of nano-additives to enhance combustion, heat transfer, and emission reduction. Nano-metal oxides such as CeO2, ZnO, and TiO2 have shown catalytic properties that promote better atomization, reduce ignition delay, and improve oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons. This study focuses on evaluating the performance and emission characteristics of WCO biodiesel blended with 25 ppm concentrations of CeO2, ZnO, and TiO2 nanoparticles in a compression ignition engine. The novelty of this work lies in the comparative assessment of different nano-additives in waste cooking oil biodiesel and their practical implications for improving sustainability in diesel engine operations. The study evaluates engine performance and emissions comprehensively using these blends in a standard diesel engine without modifications, thus emphasizing real-world feasibility. From a techno-economic standpoint, the low additive concentration combined with substantial gains in combustion efficiency and emission reduction positions this approach as a promising and scalable alternative to conventional diesel.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n\\nWaste cooking oil was converted to biodiesel by transesterification process with the help of lipase immobilized with Fe3O4 catalyst. This catalyst possesses a few advantageous properties, such as being reusable, non-toxic, immune to the effects of free fatty acids found in seed oils, an organic solvent, and an enhancement of the biodiesel production process. Initially, the necessary amount of lipase immobilised nano catalyst was placed in an airtight glass bottle (550 millilitres) and combined with raw waste cooking (250 millilitres), Fe3O4 nano catalyst (1%), while being stirred by a pellet in a magnetic stirrer at a speed ranging from 850 to 1200 rpm. This reaction was started at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius with a period of 12 min; this parameter was maintained with the operation of a magnetic stirrer, and then the complete procedure was carried out in a closed environment. During this process of transesterification, the lipase immobilised in Fe3O4 nano catalyst works to drive the reaction and continually break the chain of triglycerides that are present in raw waste cooking oil. At the end of this process, the required quantity of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) of raw waste cooking oil was successfully extracted with minimal glycerol, which improves the total yield of the reaction.\\n\\n Fuel preparation\\n\\nInitially, the required amount of lipase-immobilized Fe3O4 nano catalyst was placed in an airtight 550-milliliter glass bottle and combined with 250 millilitres of raw waste cooking oil and 1% Fe3O4 nano catalyst. The mixture was stirred using a magnetic stirrer with a pellet at a speed of 850 to 1200 rpm. Initiated at 20 °C, the reaction was kept in a sealed condition for twelve minutes. The immobilized lipase Fe3O4 nano catalyst helped the waste cooking oil triglycerides to be continuously hydrolysed, thus ensuring effective conversion into biodiesel during the transesterification process. Figure 1 represents the preparation of fuel for the experimentation. The schematic representation of interaction of nano catalyst and biodiesel as depicted in Figure 2.

The selection of a 25ppm concentration for all nano additives was based on prior literature reports[1](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7ref-CR1 \\\"Agarwal, S., Kumari, S., Mudgal, A. & Khan, S. Green synthesized nanoadditives in Jojoba biodiesel-diesel blends: an improvement of engine performance and emission. Renew. Energy. 147, 1836–1844. \\n https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.139\\n\\n (2020).\\\"), which suggested that nano additive concentrations in the range of 20–30 ppm optimize combustion characteristics while preventing nanoparticle agglomeration. Preliminary experiments in this study also validated that 25 ppm provided stable dispersion and notable improvements in engine performance.\\n\\nLipase-immobilized Fe3O4 nano catalyst\\n\\nThe lipase-immobilized Fe3O4 nano catalyst, procured from Anna University, was employed for the transesterification process. Immobilization of lipase on magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles enhances enzymatic stability, reusability, and catalytic efficiency, facilitating effective biodiesel production from waste cooking oil. The synthesis involves co-precipitation of Fe³⁺ and Fe²⁺ salts, functionalization for enzyme attachment, and subsequent lipase immobilization to ensure catalytic activity and reusability. The MNPs of Fe3O4 are first synthesized by co-precipitation of Fe³⁺ and Fe²⁺ salts in alkaline solution followed by washing and drying to obtain a stable nanostructure. For enhanced enzyme immobilisation, the Fe3O4 MNPs are functionalised with 3-amino propyltriethoxysilane (APTES) or glutaraldehyde to ensure reactive sites are formed for enzyme bonding as shown in Fig. 2. The functionalised nanoparticles are then incubated using lipase enzymes in a phosphate buffer solution to allow adsorption or covalent binding, with crosslinking possible using glutaraldehyde for enhanced stability.\\n\\nThe Fe3O4 lipase nano catalyst that is immobilized with lipase is identified using different techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), in an attempt to validate its structural stability, enzyme immobilization, and magnetic characteristics. The nano catalyst has good merits in biodiesel production, such as easy separation by magnetism, higher reusability of the enzyme, and higher catalytic activity, showing a likely sustainable process in biofuel production.in our research the biofuel after production is characterised by GCMS and FTIR analysis as shown in Fig. 3(A) and (B).\\n\\nFig. 2\\n\\nRepresentation of metal nanoparticles (MPNs) with biodiesel.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nHowever, the number of active sites has decline due to improper cleaning of fuel. These outcomes highlight the significance of addition of nano catalyst to the derived fuel. Hence, the reutilization of catalyst, specifically the Fe2O4/Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) (CeO2, TiO2 and ZnO) act as effective nano catalyst. These nano catalysts, plays a significant role to enhance the stability and whole performance in energy applications. This is mainly due to the incorporation of individual MNPs and it is function. CeO2 decreases NOx, emission of dust particle and to increases the stability of biodiesel fuel15, 101305 (2022).\\\"), TiO2 also decreases the smoky particles and enhance the combustion property and viscosity of fuel16, 331 (2020).\\\").

The reactivity and stability of above MNPs to enhance the overall performance of biofuel. The final obtain biofuel possess better efficiency compared to raw biodiesel. Hence, the efficacy of MNPS in assisting biodiesel preparation via increased catalytic conversion methods.\\n\\n GC analysis of biodiesel synthesized from waste cooking oil\\n\\nThis investigation employed precise analytical techniques to determine the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile of waste cooking oil biodiesel. Quantitative analysis was performed using the Turbo Mass Version 5.4.2 software, and gas chromatography (GC) was selected as the primary technique due to its high sensitivity and resolution for FAME detection. The analysis was carried out using an Agilent GC 6890 N system, equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and a capillary column HP-88 (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.20 μm film thickness), and specifically designed for FAME profiling.\\n\\nThe GC oven temperature program was set as follows: initial temperature of 120 °C (held for 2 min), ramped at 10 °C/min to 180 °C (held for 1 min), and followed by an increase of 3 °C/min to 240 °C (held for 10 min). The injector and detector (FID) temperatures were maintained at 260 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The carrier gas used was hydrogen, delivered at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with a split ratio of 50:1 to ensure optimal resolution. Prior to injection, the acid value was determined using 0.1 N alcoholic phenolphthalein indicator, ensuring the oil’s suitability for methyl ester conversion. Figure 3 (A) presents the GC chromatogram of the extracted FAMEs from waste cooking oil biodiesel. The major components identified included methyl palmitate (\\\\~ 35%), methyl oleate (\\\\~ 30%), and methyl linoleate (\\\\~ 20%), which are known to enhance cetane number and improve combustion characteristics in biodiesel applications.\\n\\nFig. 3\\n\\n(A**) The Fatty Acid Profile of Waste Cooking Oil Biodiesel: A GC Analysis. (B**) FTIR Analysis of Raw Waste Cooking Oil and Biodiesel.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFTIR analysis of raw waste cooking oil and biodiesel\\n\\nThe FTIR analysis was conducted to verify the transesterification process of waste cooking oil into biodiesel by confirming the disappearance of triglyceride groups and the appearance of ester functional groups, which indicates successful biodiesel formation. The FTIR instrument was employed to analyse the extracted waste cooking oil biodiesel sample for the purpose of this investigation. An omnic software version was utilised for the analysis. The investigation was carried out using a Magna 750 FTIR spectrometer that was outfitted with a Deuterated Triglycine sulphate detector. Additionally, a 7.3 KBr splitter and a Ni Chrome source were used in the process. After determining that the range between 500 and 4000 was appropriate, a resolution of 2 was applied to the FTIR spectrum that can be seen in Fig. 3(B). About 3000–2800 is the important spectrum range that generates chemical inequality between raw oil and waste cooking oil biodiesel. This area is referred to as the fingerprint region.\\n\\nThe steep peaks that may be seen in the range between 3003 and 2850 correspond to an aliphatic CH of a hybridised alkene, as well as a sp2-CH and sp3-CH stretch. In addition, the 1737 frequency peak that corresponds to the stretching of the keto group is associated with the ester. In a similar vein, the stretch in area 1627 substantiates the existence of an unsaturated double bond and does not combine with a keto group. A peak band of 3003, followed by a peak band of 2850, provides the stretching of the methyl ester group. The various spectrum bands were differentiated by a stronger band between 3000 and 2800\\\\. In the spectrum range of raw oil, the peak at 1469 was seen, and methylene groups are deserving of credit for producing it. The various characteristic peaks that were observed in the FTIR spectrum of raw waste cooking oil biodiesel was as follows: olefin group (c = c) at 1627, alkene C-H (Aliphatic) (sp2-CH) was presented at 3003, carbonyl single bond to the ester (O-C = O) was observed at 1731, and lastly, an alkane C-H (sp3-CH) component was shown at 2850\\\\. The existence of saturated fatty acids, a carbohydrate chain, and a -C = O stretch may be deduced from the appropriate absorbance peak for waste cooking oil biodiesel, which is located at 1721\\\\. (esters and acids). An amide group could be the source of the 1570 peaks in the spectrum caused by the waste cooking oil biodiesel extract. Last but not least, an increased peak at 1321 was seen in the retrieved waste cooking oil biodiesel spectra, and it was shown to be connected to the glycerol group (O-CH3). Significant peaks were identified: 1737 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group stretch indicating ester formation), 1469 cm⁻¹ (methylene group vibration), 1570 cm⁻¹ (amide group), 3003 cm⁻¹ and 2850 cm⁻¹ (sp²-CH and sp³-CH stretches), confirming successful transesterification of waste cooking oil into biodiesel.\\n\\n Characterization of cerium, zinc and titanium oxide nano additives\\n\\nThe CeO2, ZnO, and TiO2 nanoparticles used in this work were purchased from a certified commercial supplier to ensure consistency and reproducibility of particle size and quality. SEM analysis was performed to study the surface morphology and agglomeration of the nanoparticles, as these characteristics strongly affect combustion behaviour and catalytic activity when blended with biodiesel. Figure 4 (A, B, C) presents the SEM images showing the morphology of Cerium Oxide, Titanium Oxide, and Zinc Oxide nanoparticles, respectively, with an observed particle size range of 40–80 nm. SEM analysis was conducted to characterize the surface morphology and particle distribution of the synthesised nano additives. The samples were gold-coated using a sputter coater to enhance conductivity and reduce charging effects. SEM imaging was performed using a VEGA3 TESCAN scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 35 kV. The analysis was conducted under high vacuum conditions (approximately 0.02 torr) to improve image resolution. The secondary electron (SE) detector was used to capture surface topography, with a working distance maintained at 10–15 mm, optimized for depth of field and image sharpness.\\n\\nThe results indicated a uniform distribution of nanoparticles with moderate agglomeration, which is typical of powders synthesized via the sol-gel combustion method. The morphology revealed semi-spherical particles with distinct porous structures, contributing to the formation of nanoscale voids and a larger surface area, which is favourable for additive applications. In pursuit of attaining the desired premium diesel output, this study investigated the performance and emission characteristics of waste cooking oil biodiesel fuel blends with nano additives, without introducing any modifications to the diesel engine. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the fuel under scrutiny.\\n\\nFig. 4\\n\\n(A-C) SEM images of Cerium, Titanium, and Zinc Oxide Nanoadditives.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nThe fuel properties presented in Table 1 were measured using standard ASTM protocols: density by ASTM D4052 (digital density meter method), kinematic viscosity by ASTM D445 (capillary viscometer method), heating value by ASTM D240 (bomb calorimetry method), cetane number by ASTM D613 (cetane engine test), and flash point by ASTM D93 (Pensky-Martens closed cup method). Each property was measured three times under controlled laboratory conditions, and the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation to represent the reproducibility and precision of the data. The inclusion of standard deviations reflects the instrument uncertainty and experimental variability, ensuring the reliability of the measured fuel properties.\\n\\nTechnoeconomic perspective\\n\\nThe cost of raw waste cooking oil is economically favourable compared to that of virgin oils. Titanium dioxide (TiO₂), used as a nano additive at a low dosage of 25 ppm, is widely available and cost-effective, with its cost remaining marginal when distributed across the total fuel volume. Although ultrasonication requires an initial capital investment, it significantly enhances additive dispersion and fuel stability, thereby reducing maintenance demands and operational issues. Moreover, the reduction in emissions such as CO, HC, and particulate matter (PM) can help lower expenses associated with after-treatment systems and potential carbon penalties[18](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7ref-CR18 \\\"Kalargaris, I. et al.

Most existing studies either focus on a single nano additive or use higher, non-standardized concentrations, often without dispersion stability assurance.\\n\\nStability of the fuels\\n\\nThe stability of biodiesel blends containing nanoparticles is critical to ensure consistent combustion performance, injector safety, and long-term storage feasibility. In this study, a qualitative stability evaluation was performed for B20 blends incorporated with TiO₂, CeO₂, and ZnO at 25 ppm concentration using ultrasonication for 30 min at 40 kHz frequency to ensure homogeneous dispersion. Each fuel sample was stored in transparent glass containers at ambient room temperature (≈ 25 °C) for a duration of 30 days, without agitation. The samples were visually inspected at intervals of 1, 7, 15, and 30 days to check for Sediment formation at the bottom, Color changes, Phase separation, Hazy or cloudy appearance.\\n\\nObservations TiO₂-blended B20 remained visually stable with no visible sedimentation or separation for up to 30 days. ZnO and CeO₂ blends showed slight cloudiness and minimal sediment formation after 15 days, indicating potential early-stage agglomeration. All blends retained color uniformity, suggesting no major phase instability.\\n\\nTable 1 Testing fuel Properties.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\n Experimental details\\n\\nFigure 5 shows the experimental set up for the experimentation. The work was carried out using a Kirloskar single-cylinder diesel engine. Operating at 1500 revolutions per minute, this engine produced 5.2 kW. The injection timing was set at 23° before top dead centre (BTDC), and the injection pressure was maintained at 210 bar throughout the experiments. The important instruments were connected to or permanently attached to the diesel engine so that all of the research tests could be carried out. By adjusting the engine load while keeping the speed constant, we were able to approximate the outcomes of these tests. In the first phase, the diesel engine was run on its standard premium diesel fuel to establish a baseline for the full load scenario and to account for the parameters that were wanted. All the diesel fuel blends tested in this study premium diesel, waste cooking oil biodiesel, and the blends with nano additives were run in the engine without any modifications to achieve the specified output.\\n\\nThe single-cylinder diesel engine (TAF-1) type produced by the Kirloskar brand was used for this in-depth experimental study work. The different diesel engine specifications are summarized in Table 2. A data capture system’s software helped record the combustion parameters of this diesel engine on a personal computer after coupling it with an eddy current dynamometer. Next, a purpose-built software application was used to estimate and analyse the combustion properties of this engine. Located adjacent to the gasoline tank, the fuel control unit was equipped with a pressure sensor that senses the pressure of the engine’s fuel intake. The sensor is a piezoelectric pressure transducer 7063-A type linked with a Kistler instrument. We did this to make the engine run more smoothly. The analyser, encoder, and amplifier were manufactured by the Swiss company Kistler AG to distinguish the different engine input signals.\\n\\nThe engine speed of 1500 rpm was set using a connection between the flywheel, an optical sensor, and a K-type thermocouple. Monitoring exhaust gas temperature was achieved with another K-type thermocouple, while pollutant emissions underwent analysis with the AVL five-gas analyser (AVL444). Specifically, the engine was allowed to run for 20–25 min at each load condition to reach thermal equilibrium. Steady-state was confirmed by monitoring key parameters such as exhaust gas temperature, coolant temperature, lubricating oil temperature, and fuel consumption rate. Data acquisition was initiated only after these parameters remained consistent over a period of time, indicating that the engine had reached a stable operating condition. Following a 20–25 min run on premium diesel to release pollutants, SAE 40 lubricating oil was introduced to enhance the diesel engine’s efficiency. Pollutant emissions were then directed to a nondispersive infrared sensor for analysis, with smoke detected by an electrochemical sensor and NOx emissions monitored by the AVL 437 C type instrument. The diesel engine’s stopping capability was assessed at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the input load. The temperature of the ambient air is 32 °C and the humidity of the lab is 74% when experiment was performed under laboratory conditions. The HRR was derived from in-cylinder pressure data using a first-law thermodynamic approach, assuming a single-zone combustion model and incorporating volume variation with crank angle. This model assumes the combustion chamber as a homogeneous zone with uniform thermodynamic properties, which significantly simplifies the calculations while still providing meaningful insights into combustion characteristics.\\n\\nThe justification for this choice lies in its wide acceptance in preliminary combustion analysis, especially for single-cylinder engines like the Kirloskar diesel engine used in our work. It enables the estimation of global combustion trends such as ignition delay, combustion duration, and HRR profile with reasonable accuracy.\\n\\nHowever, we acknowledge the limitations of the single-zone model. It does not account for spatial variations in temperature, pressure, or fuel-air equivalence ratio, and it ignores effects such as crevice flows, heat losses to cylinder walls, and stratification. While more advanced multi-zone or CFD models can address these complexities, they require detailed input parameters and significantly higher computational resources.\\n\\nFig. 5\\n\\nEngine set up and instrumentation.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nTable 2 Engine testing parameters and their uncertainty.\\n\\nFull size table\\n\\nUncertainty and repeatability\\n\\nThe maximum tolerable deviation measures the precision of an instrument, which defines how much a quantity measured can be different from the actual or true quantity. In fact, considering variables such as the range of the instrument and extraneous variables, uncertainty is the interval within which the true result will probably fall. For example, the AVL 437 smoke meter has an accuracy of 1%, meaning that its measurement can be off by up to 1% from the actual value. Its uncertainty is also 1%, which is the measurement’s confidence interval. Similarly, the AVL GH14d pressure transducer has an accuracy of 0.1 bar and an uncertainty of 0.15%, which ensures reliable pressure measurements. The precision and reliability of the experimental results were assessed through a detailed uncertainty analysis. Measurement uncertainties were calculated by considering both instrumental errors and procedural variabilities. For calculated performance parameters like Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) and Brake Specific Energy Consumption (BSEC), the total uncertainty (U\\\\_total) was obtained using the root-sum-square (RSS) method.\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\:\\\\\\\\text{U}\\\\\\\\:\\\\\\\\text{t}\\\\\\\\text{o}\\\\\\\\text{t}\\\\\\\\text{a}\\\\\\\\text{l}\\\\\\\\:=\\\\\\\\sqrt{{U}\\\\{1}^{2}+{U}\\\\{2}^{2}+\\\\\\\\dots\\\\\\\\:.+{U}\\\\_{n}^{2}}$$\\n\\nWhere, U1, U2, U3… Un are the individual uncertainties from contributing parameters. In addition, the reproducibility of measurements has been guaranteed by repeating every test three times to enhance the reliability and lower experimental errors. Considering instrument precision and repeatability, the uncertainty in Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) and Brake Specific Energy Consumption (BSEC) measurements was ± 2.5%. Emission measurements (CO, UBHC, NOx) were within ± 3% uncertainty.\\n\\n Results and discussion\\n\\nPerformance characteristics of waste cooking oil biodiesel with nano additives\\n\\nFigure 6A and B present the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) for the various fuel blends tested. The addition of nano-additives significantly influences the combustion characteristics of biodiesel blends, contributing to improved BTE and reduced BSEC. Among the tested blends, B20 + TiO2 (25 ppm) exhibited the most favourable performance, recording a BTE of 31.21%, which is only 2.53% lower than premium diesel (32%) and 6.05% higher than regular B20 (29.32%). This enhanced performance is attributed to the catalytic nature of TiO2, which facilitates oxidation reactions through oxygen release and surface interaction. Its high surface area improves fuel atomization and evaporation, ensuring more uniform air-fuel mixing and efficient combustion. The presence of TiO2 also reduces ignition delay and enhances in-cylinder pressure rise, leading to improved thermal energy conversion. In terms of BSEC, B20 + TiO2 recorded a value of 12.08 MJ/kW.hr, showing only a 3.80% increase compared to premium diesel (11.62 MJ/kW.hr). This is significantly better than B20 without additives (13.37 MJ/kW.hr) and B100 (highest BSEC). The reduction in BSEC despite biodiesel’s inherently lower calorific value and higher viscosity is due to the improved combustion efficiency facilitated by TiO2. The additive’s thermal conductivity and catalytic action reduce energy losses and promote complete combustion, leading to better fuel utilization. Overall, TiO2 outperformed CeO2 and ZnO, which recorded lower BTE and higher BSEC values. This suggests that TiO2 is the most effective among the tested additives in enhancing engine performance using biodiesel blends.\\n\\nThe maximum brake thermal efficiency was recorded for premium diesel at 32%, and second to this was B20 blended with TiO2 (25 ppm) at 31.21%. This is a drop of 2.53% compared to diesel and an increase of 6.05% over regular B20\\\\. The CeO2 and ZnO blends exhibited a slightly lower BTE of 30.08% and 30.01%, respectively, while B20 without any nano-additives exhibited a BTE of 29.32%. The poorest efficiency was obtained with B100 at 26.9%, which was caused by its high viscosity, low calorific value, and poor volatility, resulting in incomplete combustion and excessive energy losses. The BSEC was the lowest for the high diesel at 11.62 MJ/kW.hr, followed by a value of 12.08 MJ/kW.hr for the B20 + TiO2 (25 ppm) blend, indicating a modest rise of merely 3.80%. The CeO2\\\\-ZnO mixtures recorded slightly higher BSEC values of 12.21 MJ/kW.hr and 12.51 MJ/kW.hr, respectively, whereas B20 was 13.37 MJ/kW.hr, indicating the higher energy demand for biodiesel blends without nano-additives. The study indicates the feasibility of adopting nano-additive-doped biodiesel as a substitute fuel, highlighted on its ability to improve efficiency and reduce environmental footprints with little need for adapting traditional engine systems. While our study notes a slight reduction in BTE (2.53%) and increase in NOX (8.58%) with B20 + TiO2, it also reports significant reductions in UBHC, CO, and smoke emissions, showing improved combustion and cleaner exhaust.\\n\\nFig. 6\\n\\n(A**) Brake Thermal Efficiency Concerning Brake Power.

The B20 + TiO2 blend showed slightly lower BTE compared to diesel due to the lower calorific value of biodiesel. However, the presence of TiO2 improved combustion efficiency by enhancing atomization and reducing ignition delay. The marginal increase in BSEC for biodiesel blends was attributed to the higher viscosity and density compared to diesel.\\n\\nCombustion characteristics of waste cooking oil biodiesel with nano additives\\n\\nFigure 7(A) shows the in-cylinder pressure variation with crank angle, while Fig. 7(B) presents the corresponding heat release rate (HRR). Premium diesel recorded the highest in-cylinder pressure at 59.86 bar, followed by B20 + TiO2 (58.82 bar), B20 + CeO2 (57.21 bar), and B20 + ZnO (57.21 bar). B20 without additives and B100 recorded 56.97 bar and 54.48 bar, respectively. The near-maximum cylinder pressure observed for B20 + TiO2 reflects better combustion stability due to improved atomization and oxygen diffusion promoted by the additive.\\n\\nThe enhanced combustion process is driven by TiO2’s high thermal conductivity and oxygen buffering capability. These properties promote quicker and more complete combustion, resulting in shorter ignition delay and more stable combustion phasing. The nano-additive’s surface catalysis supports fuel breakdown and oxidation, contributing to elevated in-cylinder pressures with minimal energy loss. The HRR values presented in Fig. 7(B) show a maximum of 71.71 J/°CA for premium diesel, followed by 66.65 J/°CA for B20 + TiO2, and progressively lower values for CeO2, ZnO, and B20\\\\. B100 recorded the lowest HRR. The 7.59% reduction in HRR for B20 + TiO2, compared to diesel, reflects the change in combustion dynamics due to the nano-additive. Despite a lower peak HRR, the broader and smoother release curve indicates more stable and prolonged combustion, which is beneficial for reducing knocking and improving fuel efficiency. In summary, the combustion analysis confirms that TiO2 promotes more efficient combustion through improved atomization, oxygen diffusion, and catalytic effects, helping biodiesel blends to approach the performance of premium diesel. The observed effects result in improved energy conversion with no fuel loss, which guarantees the maximum possible peak cylinder pressure (PCP) and ID duration[19](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7ref-CR19 \\\"Raju, P., Masimalai, S.

TiO2 nanoparticles act as oxygen donors, releasing oxygen radicals at elevated temperatures and thereby promoting the complete oxidation of CO to CO₂ and HC to CO2 and H2O. CeO2 nanoparticles participate in a reversible Ce³⁺/Ce⁴⁺ redox cycle, functioning as an oxygen buffer that stores and releases oxygen during combustion, which shortens ignition delay and improves combustion completeness.\\n\\n$$\\\\\\\\text{CeO}\\\\{2} \\\\\\\\leftrightarrow \\\\\\\\text{Ce}\\\\{2}\\\\\\\\text{O}\\\\{3} + 1/2 \\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\text{O}\\\\2$$\\n\\nZnO nanoparticles, on the other hand, act as catalysts by lowering the activation energy of oxidation reactions, enhancing fuel–air mixing, and facilitating faster combustion. Collectively, these mechanisms explain the reduction in CO, HC, and smoke emissions, along with the improvements in thermal efficiency observed in this study.\\n\\nCylinder pressure and heat release rate (HRR) analysis revealed a 1.76% reduction in peak pressure and a 7.59% decrease in HRR for the TiO2 blend. These changes are linked to delayed ignition and enhanced atomization caused by the nano additive’s oxygen buffering capacity, which promotes smoother combustion and reduces knocking tendency23 blends operated in a single cylinder diesel engine: performance, combustion and emission characteristics. Energy 215, 119091 (2021).\\\").\\n\\nEmission characteristics of waste cooking oil biodiesel with nano additives\\n\\nEmission measurements, including unburned hydrocarbons (UBHC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and smoke, were recorded and analyzed with respect to brake power (Fig. 8A&B and 9A&B). B20 + TiO2 consistently showed the best emission performance among the biodiesel blends. UBHC emissions were reduced by 17.41% with B20 + TiO2 compared to premium diesel, due to enhanced oxidation and complete combustion. The TiO2 additive helps maintain optimal in-cylinder temperatures and prevents quenching effects near the cylinder wall, thereby minimizing hydrocarbon residues. Its catalytic activity promotes degradation of unburned hydrocarbon chains, ensuring minimal UBHC in the exhaust. CO emissions showed a 36.36% reduction with B20 + TiO2. This is due to the high oxygen content and improved oxidation efficiency of the blend, which promotes full conversion of CO to CO2 during combustion. TiO2’s role in reducing ignition delay and improving combustion phasing further ensures lower CO formation. NOx emissions, however, increased by 8.58% with B20 + TiO2, a typical trend in biodiesel combustion due to higher in-cylinder temperatures and increased oxygen availability. Nonetheless, TiO2 produced the lowest NOx among the nano-additive blends. This is attributed to its oxygen buffering capability, which helps regulate combustion temperature and limits localized hot spots. The nanoparticle also aids in more uniform heat distribution, partially mitigating NOx formation. Smoke emissions were reduced by 16.25% with B20 + TiO2 compared to diesel. TiO2 acts as a combustion enhancer, promoting complete oxidation of carbonaceous compounds and reducing soot formation. Improved atomization and fuel-air mixing further contribute to this effect. In summary, TiO2 significantly improves emission performance by lowering UBHC, CO, and smoke emissions while moderately increasing NOx, which can be managed by incorporating exhaust after-treatment technologies such as EGR or SCR systems in future studies. The enhanced catalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles facilitates the degradation of hydrocarbon chains more effectively, reducing unburned fuel residues and thus contributing to overall emission reductions[24](ref-CR24 \\\"Subramaniam, M., Solomon, J.

Hence, TiO2 in fuel mixture supports a more uniform combustion reaction with lower nitrogen oxidation than some nano-additive fuel mixtures[29](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR29 \\\"Duraisamy, G., Rangasamy, M. & Hossain, A.

The behavior is said to increase as the percentage of the fuel blend grew, in addition to greater smoke emissions, especially at full load condition. It was, however, noted that the premium diesel recorded maximum smoke emissions when compared to all the biodiesel fuel blends. The smoke emission levels for different fuel blends were 78.4 HSU for premium diesel, 67.44 HSU for B20 + TiO2 (25 ppm), 68.54 HSU for B20 + CeO2 (25 ppm), 68.5 HSU for B20 + ZnO (25 ppm), 71.85 HSU for B20, and 68.8 HSU for B100\\\\. Among these, the B20 + TiO2 (25 ppm) mixture showed an enormous reduction of 16.25% in smoke emissions in comparison to premium diesel under load conditions. The phase of diffusion burning is also improved to prevent the possibility of sooting and providing improved air-fuel mixing to inhibit local zones of fuel enrichment, which characteristically form locations of partial burning. The greater thermal conductivity of TiO2 also promotes more even distribution of heat and prevents local cooling, which reduces temperature drops contributing to soot. These complementary effects are credited with the noticed reduction in emissions of smoke that render B20 + TiO2 (25 ppm) less harmful to the environment compared to regular diesel fuel and other blends of nano-additives[31](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR31 \\\"Rami Reddy, S., Murali, G. & Dhana Raju, V.

This difference could stem from variations in nanoparticle concentration, base fuel properties, or engine operating conditions. In our case, the NOx reduction may have been limited due to higher in-cylinder temperatures associated with enhanced combustion, which can offset the NOx suppression effect of oxygenated fuels.\\n\\nThe emission trends also align with findings from Sajjad et al.[35](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR35 \\\"Sajjad, W. et al.

This could be influenced by the nanoparticle size, dispersion method (ultrasonication vs. mechanical stirring), and engine load condition.\\n\\nThe only adverse effect was an 8.58% increase in NOₓ emissions, which is consistent with biodiesel’s inherent oxygen content and elevated combustion temperature. However, the increase in NOₓ was lower with TiO₂ than with CeO2 and ZnO due to TiO2’s oxygen-buffering ability, which tempers the peak flame temperatures.\\n\\nThis is in agreement with findings reported by Sajjadi et al.[35](/articles/s41598-025-17528-7#ref-CR35 \\\"Sajjad, W. et al.

These comparisons reinforce the importance of standardized testing protocols and nanoparticle characterization to enable more meaningful cross-study evaluations. While previous research has investigated the influence of individual nanoparticles on biodiesel performance and emissions, the present study advances the field by offering a comparative evaluation of three different nano-additives (TiO2, CeO2, and ZnO) blended with waste cooking oil biodiesel. This comparative approach not only identifies TiO2 as the most effective additive for enhancing combustion efficiency and reducing emissions but also provides deeper insights into the underlying chemical mechanisms that govern these improvements. By combining renewable waste-derived fuel with nano-scale catalytic enhancement, this work contributes novel evidence toward developing cleaner, more efficient, and practically viable biodiesel formulations for diesel engine applications.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe results of the present research anchor the viability of waste cooking oil-based biodiesel mixed with nano additive as a renewable and environmentally friendly fuel compared to traditional diesel fuel.\\n\\nExperimental investigation revealed that B20 + TiO2 (25 ppm) fuel had enhanced performance and emission properties under single-cylinder CI engine operating at peak load condition at 1500 rpm. Addition of nano additives like Cerium, Zinc, and Titanium oxide led to improvement in combustion efficiency and extreme reduction in harmful emissions compared to premium diesel. B20 + TiO2 exhibited the most encouraging outcome, which emphasizes the significant role played by Titanium oxide in fuel optimization. Nevertheless, such benefits notwithstanding, the research also reflects specific limitations worthy of further study. The B20 + TiO2 (25 ppm) blend has shown slight brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) reduction of 2.53% and 3.80%, respectively, against the premium diesel.\\nAlso, the slight reduction in pressure in the cylinder and in the heat release rate (HRR) were seen at larger crank angles at a rate of 1.76% and 7.59%, respectively. Such fluctuation may be adjusted due to the enhanced atomization and postponed ignition process which result in maintaining stability during combustion. Though these are small variations in the performance parameters, optimization of fuel injection strategy and combustion parameters can offset such losses and provide better efficiency. Long-term engine durability testing will also be essential to determine probable effects of nano additives on engine components with respect to wear and deposit formation. For the emissions, B20 + TiO2 showed a reduction of 17.41% in unburned hydrocarbons (UBHC), a reduction of 36.36% in carbon monoxide (CO) emission, and a reduction of 16.24% in smoke emission when compared to diesel. However, the sole limitation noted was the increase in nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) emissions by 8.58%, a typical defect noted with the use of biodiesel owing to the existence of greater oxygen content and enhanced combustion properties.\\nWhile NOₓ formation is more directly associated with high combustion temperatures, methods like exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) or catalytic after-treatment systems can be investigated to avoid these emissions without compromising the fuel’s overall advantages. There also must be further research that confirms the long-term dispersion behaviour and stability of nano additives when they are present in biodiesel so that for sustained performance, it can disperse in an even fuel matrix. Application of nano additives such as TiO2 with waste cooking oil biodiesel at 25 ppm is one potential move towards cleaner and more sustainable fuels. This abolishes the use of fossil fuels and supports the environment through emissions reduction. Still, there are issues involving NOₓ emissions, stability of fuel, and long-term consequences on the engine parts which have to be eliminated in favour of making the blends more comfortable to produce for commercial and large-scale industrial utilization.\\nThe slight increase in NOx emissions with B20 + TiO2 is primarily due to higher combustion temperatures resulting from better oxygen availability and combustion efficiency. However, TiO2’s oxygen buffering property helps minimize localized hot-spots, slightly mitigating NOx compared to CeO2 and ZnO2 blends. Potential challenges like nano additive agglomeration, injector wear, and long-term engine deposit formation are recognized and merit future investigation. Additionally, the use of a single engine type, variability in waste cooking oil quality, and laboratory-scale conditions limit the broader generalizability of findings.\\nAdditional research into the optimization of nano additive levels, and on-board engine testing under different operating regimes, will be necessary in proving the viability and scalability of this fuel blend as an energy source.\\n\\n Data availability\\n\\nThe datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAgarwal, S., Kumari, S., Mudgal, A. & Khan, S.

Lockhart and John Moritz, CT Mirror \\nDecember 1, 2025\\n\\n New Haven plant now the East Coast’s largest producer of biofuels by P.R. Lockhart and John Moritz, CT Mirror December 1, 2025 Inside a green metal-clad building in the Port of New Haven, a kind of modern day alchemy is at work, turning used cooking oil into fuel capable of powering trucks and heating homes. Within a maze of tightly stacked tanks, pipes and collection units, workers take the grease — or other available waste products such as animal fats, tallow and vegetable oils — and add an alcohol catalyst to trigger a chemical reaction that produces biodiesel, which is marketed as a more climate friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels. A series of rapid expansions in recent years has made the plant, home of American GreenFuels, the largest producer of biodiesel on the East Coast. Originally opened in 2011 as Greenleaf Biofuels, the plant was later purchased by the American division of Swiss commodities trader Kolmar Group and renamed American GreenFuels. Since 2016, its output has quadrupled, from 15 million gallons to nearly 60 million gallons a year. The most recent expansion, completed this summer, added a second story to the production floor. \\\"It often smells like french fries, as you might expect,\\\" said Paul Teta, the vice president and general counsel for Kolmar Americas, which is based in Shelton. The company's growth has been spurred, in part, by government subsidies and laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Teta declined to say how much the company has invested in its New Haven plant, other than to say it was in the \\\"many millions of dollars.\\\" According to Kolmar, the biodiesel made at its New Haven facility produces 86% less greenhouse gas emissions, on average, compared with ultralow-sulfur heating oil. The emissions reductions are even more substantial when the fuel is sold and burned in Connecticut, removing the need to transport it long distances on trucks. New York City passed the nation's first blended biofuel mandate in 2012 and was followed by a state laws in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

Country-specific wastes inventories remain to be combined with biofuel conversion pathways to unravel the decarbonization potentials in global food transportation. Herein, we design a food system internal loop and quantify multi-path biofuel production from used cooking oil and crop residues across 130 countries to evaluate effects on fossil fuel substitution and carbon dioxide emission reductions. Road transportation dominates fossil fuel demands (80.7%) and emissions (79.5%) in food transportation. China and the United States excel in production of biofuels from two sources. Maximum production of both types of biofuels reaches 0.41 and 38.77 exajoules, respectively. Utilizing all available used cooking oil and less than 20% of crop residues could completely satisfy food transportation fuel demands in most countries while mitigating emissions by 174.9 million tons (around 70%).\\n\\n Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\nFood waste used as a resource can reduce climate and resource burdens in agrifood systems \\n\\nArticle 11 March 2025 \\n\\n PO2/TransformON, an ontology for data integration on food, feed, bioproducts and biowaste engineering \\n\\nArticle Open access 04 September 2023 \\n\\nMicrobial production of advanced biofuels \\n\\nArticle 25 June 2021 \\n\\n Introduction\\n\\nThe food system, as a key component of human economic activity, is responsible for approximately one-third of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions1.\\\"). Food transportation bridges food and transportation systems. A study based on “food miles” concept revealed that, when considering the entire food supply chain, emissions from food transportation account for \\\\~19% of global food system emissions2.\\\"). This underscores the critical need for strategies aimed at mitigating emissions associated with food transportation, contributing co-benefits in decarbonizing both food system and transportation system.\\n\\nWith global population growth and an increasing demand for food, the amount of wastes generated by food system has risen sharply. Proper management of food system wastes has thus become a crucial aspect of controlling or mitigating emissions within food system3.\\\"),4.\\\"),5.\\\"),6.\\\"),7.\\\"). The conversion of food system wastes into biofuels for transportation has already seen widespread application. Among food system wastes, used cooking oil (UCO) and crop residues (CRs) demonstrate advantages in collection and treatment efficiency, exhibiting more homogeneous compositions compared with other wastes such as kitchen waste. Additionally, the technologies for their conversion into biofuels are more mature, establishing them as primary feedstocks for biofuel production8.\\\"),9.\\\"),10.\\\"),11.\\\"). Biodiesel is the most common form of biofuels, primarily used in road, railway & inland waterway, and marine transportation12.\\\"),13 420–424 (PEEIC, 2018).\\\"),14.\\\").\\n\\nEstablished pathways for converting UCO include esterification-hydrogenation and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) processes following hydrolysis15.\\\"),16.\\\"). Esterification-hydrogenation yields high-quality biodiesel suitable for road, rail, and inland waterway transport by effectively converting UCO fatty acids. HEFA technology, involving high-pressure hydrogenation, transforms UCO lipids into drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), currently the dominant bio-aviation pathway, achieving higher energy density and combustion performance17.\\\"),18 265–286 (Springer Nature, Singapore, 2023).\\\"),19.\\\"),20.\\\"). CRs can be converted via fast pyrolysis or gasification-Fischer-Tropsch synthesis21.\\\"),22.\\\"). Fast pyrolysis rapidly decomposes solid biomass into liquid bio-oil, while Fischer-Tropsch synthesis produces premium liquid fuels from syngas without requiring specific feedstock chemical structures, making it suitable for producing Fischer-Tropsch aviation fuel from lignocellulosic materials like CRs17.\\\"),18 265–286 (Springer Nature, Singapore, 2023).\\\"),19.\\\"),20.\\\"). Life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely employed to compare different fuel technologies, with numerous studies demonstrating that biofuels, when replacing fossil fuels, result in significant emission reduction23 people’s republic of China. Appl. Energy 86, S197–S208 (2009).\\\"),24.\\\"),25.\\\"). Regarding the collection and energy potential of CRs and UCO, a large number of research has estimated the amount of CRs available in different regions based on crop yields and residue indices26.\\\"),27.\\\"),28.\\\"),29.\\\"). When estimating the energy potential of CRs, it is crucial to account for competing uses beyond biofuel production30.\\\"),31.\\\"). Contextualized in the diverse ways of CRs utilization, and the influence of climate and dietary habits on their spatial distribution, extant research has conducted analysis of CRs’ competing uses targeting typical countries or regions32.\\\"),33.\\\"),34.\\\"). Studies on UCO recycling predominantly address collection and transportation strategies at the consumption end35.\\\"),36.\\\"). Unlike CRs, which have multiple competing uses, the main energy utilization pathway for UCO is biodiesel production34.\\\"),35.\\\"),36.\\\"),37.\\\"). Various conversion technologies have been examined to explore UCO’s potential for biofuel production38.\\\"),39.\\\"),40.\\\"),41.\\\").\\n\\nBuilding on studies of food system wastes’ energy potentials, some research has also analyzed the emission reduction benefits of biofuel production from food system wastes in specific regions. Typical studies cover estimates of the emission reduction potential of biodiesel produced from CRs in Europe for use in marine transportation42.\\\"), assessment of the bioenergy potential and emission reduction contributed by CRs utilization in China43.\\\"), analysis of the environmental impacts of converting UCO to biodiesel in China44.\\\"), and evaluation of the emission reduction effect of biodiesel produced from UCO in Iran under specific UCO recycling strategies45.\\\"). These studies further demonstrate the potential of utilizing wastes-derived biofuels for controlling transportation emissions in practical applications.\\n\\nWhile converting food system wastes to biofuels has demonstrated effectiveness in fossil fuel substitution and emission reduction, critical knowledge gaps remain. First, from a food system perspective, the energy and environmental benefits feedback achievable by repurposing such biofuels specifically for food transportation remains unclear. Second, existing research lacks an integrated analytical framework that concurrently addresses global variations in food system wastes availability and disparate food transportation fuel demands across countries. Consequently, the extent to which domestically produced biofuels can offset heterogeneous transportation fossil fuel demands remains unknown, hindering the characterization of individual countries’ contributions to decarbonizing global food and transportation systems.\\n\\nTo address these gaps, this study establishes an internal recycling loop within the food system where food system waste streams are repurposed for food transportation. It aims to quantify national-level biofuel production potentials from such wastes and evaluate the corresponding contribution in decarbonizing food system transportation by substituting fossil fuels. The internal recycling loop within food system is illustrated in Fig. 1, the food system spans five sequential stages: agricultural production, food transportation and trade, processing and transformation, retail and provisioning, and food consumption. UCO and CRs generated from these stages are collected and processed into biofuels. These biofuels then substitute fossil fuels across various transportation modes (road, railway & inland waterway, marine, aviation), providing energy for food transportation while reducing emissions within the food system. Though biofuel utilization may extend beyond food-related transportation in practice, emerging carbon trading mechanisms and global carbon market developments enable the reallocation of environmental benefits to food systems through carbon quota allocations or fiscal incentives46.\\\"),47.\\\"). This approach creates synergistic feedback between emission reductions in the transportation sector and sustainability improvements in food production chains.\\n\\nFig. 1: Design of food system internal loop.\\n\\nThe icons used are sourced from .\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFrom the food system internal loop perspective, targeting 130 countries in the world, the availability and biofuel production potentials of CRs and UCO in various countries are accounted, combined with examining country-specific fossil fuel demands of food transportation adopting multiregional input-output model (MRIO). On this basis, four scenarios are designed to analyze the biofuel production and emission reduction contributions under varying food system wastes utilization levels (scenario of sole UCO utilization, scenario of sole CRs utilization, scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization, and scenario of maximum biofuel production potential). The life cycle analysis and GREET (greenhouse gases, regulated emissions, and energy use in transportation) model are combined to compare the well-to-wheel/haul/wake (WTW/WTH/WTWa) emissions from typical biofuels and fossil fuels under the four scenarios, including emissions from the production phase (well-to-pump, WTP) and the operation phase (pump-to-wheel/haul/wake, PTW/PTH/PTWa). The findings are expected to provide references for informing global energy utilization strategies of food system wastes, and sustainability of food transportation.\\n\\nResults\\n\\n Fossil fuel demand of global food transportation\\n\\nAnalysis of this study reveals that the aggregate food transportation fossil fuel demand across 130 countries amounts to around 3.0 EJ (1 EJ = 1018 J), constituting 3.3% of total transportation fossil fuel demand. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of food transportation fossil fuel demands across various transportation modes. As one of the world’s preeminent food producers and consumers, China exhibits substantially higher food transportation fossil fuel demand compared with other countries. Similarly, other major food-producing countries, including India, Brazil, the United States, and Russia, demonstrate elevated demand, while the African and Middle Eastern countries show comparatively lower demand. Among four transportation modes, road transportation dominates the fossil fuel demand, accounting for \\\\~80.6% of total demand across 130 countries. Aviation and marine transport follow with 8.4% and 7.4% respectively. Railway & inland waterway transportation exhibits significantly lower fossil fuel dependence (3.6% combined), primarily due to the higher electrification levels of railway. Regionally, railway & inland waterway fuel demands are concentrated in China, Latin America, and the Middle East, with China and Russia recording elevated shares of 8.86% and 6.25% respectively. Notably, archipelagic and coastal countries like the Philippines, Brunei, and Indonesia demonstrate exceptional marine fossil fuel intensity, with marine transportation constituting over 20% of their national fossil fuel consumption.\\n\\nFig. 2: Fossil fuel demand of global food transportation.\\n\\nThe color depth presents the amount of fossil fuel demand, and the pie chart presents the fuel demand shares across transportation modes in the top 30 countries with emissions.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nBiofuel production from food system wastes\\n\\nThis study suggests that the theoretically maximum biofuel production from UCO across 130 countries reaches 0.41 EJ (1.03%), while CRs-derived biofuels exhibit an overwhelmingly higher potential of 38.77 EJ (98.97%). This disparity arises because CRs possess inherent advantages in sheer amount, being inevitable agricultural byproducts with broad geographical distribution. While UCO, despite its higher conversion efficiency, is constrained by limited waste oil availability and immature collection infrastructure. These limitations collectively restrict UCO’s total biofuel production potential far below that of CRs. Figure 3 delineates the biofuel production from UCO and CRs across countries, revealing that those with higher food production and consumption demonstrate correspondingly greater potentials. Regionally, for UCO-derived biofuel production, China (106.8 PJ, 1 PJ = 1015 J) and the United States (100.0 PJ) collectively contribute 51.0% of the global total, driven by their extensive food service industries and consumption patterns. Major oilseed-producing countries, including Indonesia (32.6 PJ), Malaysia (29.5 PJ), and India (15.8 PJ), form the secondary tier, contributing 19.2% of the global total and correlating with their expanding vegetable oil utilization in food processing sectors. For CRs-derived biofuel production, major agricultural countries demonstrate overwhelming advantages: China (10.7 EJ), the United States (8.2 EJ), India (7.6 EJ), and Brazil (6.4 EJ) collectively account for 55.2% of the total, supported by vast croplands and high-intensity farming systems. Other leading grain producers such as Russia and Argentina follow, with CRs-derived biofuel production surpassing 2 EJ.\\n\\nFig. 3: Food system wastes-derived biofuel production across countries.\\n\\nThe values mean the energy equivalents of UCO and CRs-derived biofuels, respectively, without considering other utilization purposes of UCO and CRs, showing a theoretically maximum level. a** UCO-derived biofuels. **b CRs-derived biofuels.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nThe biofuel production from UCO and CRs varies significantly depending on their utilization rate (especially competing uses for CRs) and energy conversion efficiency. UCO demonstrates superior energy conversion efficiency compared with CRs (Table S5 in Supplementary Information), yielding higher biofuel production per unit of wastes (PJ). Figure 4 presents a comparative result between fossil fuel demand and biofuel production from UCO and CRs across 11 regions (divided according to World Oil Outlook from OPEC[48](/articles/s43247-025-02891-0ref-CR48 \\\"Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Table S8 provides detailed country-specific data regarding the fossil fuel demand that could be satisfied by UCO and CRs-derived biofuels. In the scenario of sole UCO utilization, significant biofuel production is seen in Asia, OECD Americas, and Europe. In the scenario of sole CRs utilization, despite a 7% utilization limit, CRs show broader potential, with over a third of 130 countries fully covering their food transportation fossil fuel demand. This performance confirms CRs’ persistently superior biofuel production capacity relative to UCO, attributable to their fundamental advantage in sheer production amount. The scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization outperforms sole-feedstock scenarios, meeting most food transportation fossil fuel demand except in the Middle East and Russia. In the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, the biofuel production exceeds food transportation fossil fuel demand in most regions, with India and Latin America capable of meeting their entire transportation sector’s fossil fuel demand (Fig. S2).\\n\\nFig. 4: Comparison of food system wastes-derived biofuel production and food transportation fossil fuel demand.\\n\\na** Scenario of sole UCO utilization. **b Scenario of sole CRs utilization (considering competing uses of CRs). c** Scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization. **d Scenario of maximum biofuel production potential.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nEmission reductions in food transportation through food system wastes-derived biofuels\\n\\nTotal emissions from the production and use of fossil fuels in food transportation across 130 countries are 256.6 million metric tonnes (Mt) CO2. Figure 5 shows emission distributions across four transportation modes in 11 regions. Road transportation dominates the total emissions, contributing 204.7 Mt CO₂ (80.7% of emissions across four modes), followed by aviation and marine transportation with tied contributions (19.8 Mt CO₂, 7.8%). Railway & inland waterway transportation exhibits the lowest emissions at 9.2 Mt CO₂, accounting for only 3.7%. Regionally, China exhibits the highest emissions across all modes except marine transportation, with road transportation (48.5 Mt CO₂, 23.7% of global road transportation emissions) and railway & inland waterway transportation (4.9 Mt CO₂, 53.5% of global railway & inland waterway transportation emissions) being particularly significant. Other Asian regions, the Middle East, and Latin America collectively account for around half of marine transportation emissions, each exceeding 25 Mt CO₂. In aviation transportation, OECD European countries (31.95 Mt CO₂, 16.12% of global aviation transportation emissions) emerge as major contributors alongside China.\\n\\nFig. 5: Food transportation emissions across transportation modes.\\n\\na** Total emissions of four transportation modes. **b Emissions of road transportation. c** Emissions of railway & inland waterway transportation. **d Emissions of marine transportation. *e* Emissions of aviation transportation.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nEach country exhibits distinct emission reduction profiles in food transportation by utilizing food system wastes-derived biofuels. Figure 6a–d illustrates country-specific emission reductions across scenarios, with details for 130 countries presented in Table S9. The scenario of sole UCO utilization achieves 28.9 Mt CO₂ reductions (11.4% of food transportation emissions), with emission reduction proportions in high UCO producers like Malaysia and Indonesia being as high as over 95%, while other countries mostly achieve reductions in the 0−20% range in this scenario. The scenario of sole CRs utilization achieves 119.1 Mt CO₂ reductions (47.0%), with China, India, Brazil, and the US contributing above half of total reductions. Approximately half of the analyzed countries attain over 50% reductions in their national emissions. The scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization achieves 135.0 Mt CO₂ reductions (53.2%), nearly half of the analyzed countries could achieve complete offset of food transportation fossil fuel demand through food system wastes-derived biofuels, achieving 70%−83% emission reductions. Under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, reductions reach 174.9 Mt CO₂ (69.0%), with only 21 countries’ food transportation fossil fuel demands being incompletely offset by food system wastes-derived biofuels, and nearly 80% of countries achieving an emission reduction proportion over 70%.\\n\\nFig. 6: Emission reductions and emission reduction proportions in food transportation contributed by food system wastes-derived biofuels.\\n\\nThe color depth represents the amount of emission reductions, and different colored markings represent the emission reduction proportion. a** Scenario of sole UCO utilization. **b Scenario of sole CRs utilization. c** Scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization. **d Scenario of maximum biofuel production potential. *e* emission reduction across transportation modes in four scenarios. Scenario 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively represent scenario of sole UCO utilization, scenario of sole CRs utilization, scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization and scenario of maximum biofuel production potential. RO, RA, MR, and AV respectively represent four modes of transportation: road, railway & inland waterway, marine, and aviation. The codes of 130 countries are referred to ISO 3166-1 from , as presented in Table S1.\\n\\nFull size image\\n\\nFor four transportation modes, UCO-derived biofuels excel in reducing emissions from road, railway & inland waterway, while CRs-derived biofuels are more effective for marine and aviation (Table S7). As road transportation accounts for the highest fuel demand among the four modes, UCO-derived biofuels generally achieve greater overall emission reductions per unit when implementing biofuel substitution according to fuel demand shares for four modes. Under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, road transportation demonstrates global leadership in emission reduction, achieving 130.8 Mt CO₂ reductions, constituting 76.9% of total food transportation emissions mitigation. Aviation and marine transportation follow with 17.3 Mt CO₂ (9.9%) and 16.7 Mt CO₂ (9.5%) reductions respectively, while railway & inland waterway transportation, constrained by existing electrification levels of railway, contribute marginally at 6.46 Mt CO₂ (3.7%). Figure 6e shows emission reduction proportions across regions, transportation modes, and scenarios. All countries exhibit consistent, substantial road transportation reductions, particularly in the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential. Emission reductions in marine transportation are concentrated in coastal and island regions (e.g., the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia), where marine transportation contributes up to 20% of national mitigation totals. Middle Eastern countries and Russia exhibit 30% mitigation enhancement under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential compared to the scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization, indicating that elevated\\n\\n Uncertainty analysis\\n\\nThe calculations of fossil fuel demand, biofuel production, food transportation emissions, and emission reductions are rigorously examined using Monte Carlo analysis. The yield coefficients of CRs, along with the collection coefficients of CRs and UCO, determine the utilizable amount of food system wastes. The energy conversion coefficients of UCO and CRs, combined with their biofuel conversion coefficients, critically influence the amount of biofuel production. The fuel demand shares for four transportation modes directly govern fossil fuel demand across four transportation modes, which is essential for estimating fossil fuel emissions in food transportation. Additionally, WTW emission coefficients of biofuels and fossil fuels serve as pivotal parameters for quantifying emissions and emission reductions in food transportation. These key factors have therefore been incorporated into the uncertainty analysis of calculation outcomes.\\n\\nThe Monte Carlo method employs triangular distributions for parameter estimation, generating 10,000 independent simulations, with results aggregated using statistical indicators. As shown in Fig. 7, road transportation exhibits a broader uncertainty range in fossil fuel demand and emission calculations compared to other transportation modes, primarily due to its higher fuel demand share. The substantially greater utilizable amount of CRs relative to UCO amplifies uncertainty in the CRs derived-biofuel production potentials. Furthermore, the uncertainty ranges of emission reductions across the four scenarios increase incrementally with rising emission reduction levels, with the scenario of sole UCO utilization demonstrating a notably smaller uncertainty range than the other three scenarios.\\n\\nFig. 7: Uncertainty analysis results.\\n\\nThe rectangular box spans from the first quartile (Q1, 25%) to the third quartile (Q3, 75%), representing the middle 50% of the data.

The oil will then be delivered to Quatra sites for filtering before being shipped to TotalEnergies’ biorefineries to produce road biofuels and SAF. \\nTotalEnergies has converted its refineries at La Mède in the south of France and Grandpuits near Paris into biorefineries. \\n“I am delighted with this strategic agreement with Quatra that contributes to our aim to secure the feedstock we need to produce biofuels in our biorefineries. The development of biofuels is one of our Company’s strategic goals. By directly reducing the carbon intensity of the energy products used by our customers, we are actively working with them as part of our net zero approach, together with society,” said Valérie Goff, senior vice-president, renewable fuels & chemicals at TotalEnergies. \\n“At Quatra, we believe in long-term partnerships with leading industrial groups that combine logistics, environmental responsibility and financial viability. The deal between Quatra France and TotalEnergies is an excellent example of that. By supplying locally collected used cooking oil, we are contributing to a sustainable value chain. That allows us to focus on our core business, which is the efficient collection of used cooking oil across France, allowing TotalEnergies to turn that valuable resource into biofuel,” stated Pol Van Pollaert, Co-CEO, Quatra. \\n\\n CONNECT WITH US\\n\\nPopular News Stories\\n\\nMoeve and Galp negotiate to combine downstream activities\\n\\nPetrobas and Vale agree to use B15 in mining operations\\n\\n‘New chapter’ at Gevo CEO prepares to step down\\n\\nStellantis embarks on HVO Aurora trial\\n\\nSalvador Bahia airport becomes Brazil’s first to supply commercial flights with SAF\\n\\n LATEST VIDEOS\\n\\nThe Science That Keeps Biofuels Flowing \\n\\nThe Must Attend Event for 2026\\n\\n Poll\\n\\nDo you believe current global supply of biofuels can keep up with projected demand?\\n\\nYes\\nNo\\n\\nView Results\\n\\n Loading ...\\n\\n Biofuels Int Follow It's the leading magazine covering all and everything to do with biodiesel and bioethanol. \\n\\n Biofuels Int @biofuelsmag · \\n\\n24h \\n\\n The Department for Transport has awarded £181,000 in funding through the UK Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Clearing House to four leading innovators - #Avioxx Ltd, #Clean\\\\Planet Technologies Ltd, #Green\\\\Lizard Technologies Ltd, and Zero Petroleum Ltd. \\nhttps://biofuels-news.com/news/uk-government-funds-four-saf-innovators-to-accelerate-aviation-decarbonisation/ \\n\\n Reply on Twitter 2016436081680339449 Retweet on Twitter 2016436081680339449 2 Like on Twitter 2016436081680339449 1 Twitter 2016436081680339449 \\n\\n Biofuels Int @biofuelsmag · \\n\\n27 Jan \\n\\n #Iowa’s #biodiesel #production fell sharply in 2025, dropping 31% year on year to 244 million gallons, according to new figures from the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA). \\nhttps://biofuels-news.com/news/iowa-biodiesel-production-fell-sharply-in-2025/ \\nbiofuels output #production #feedstock #biodiesel \\n\\n Reply on Twitter 2016122340501856763 Retweet on Twitter 2016122340501856763 2 Like on Twitter 2016122340501856763 3 Twitter 2016122340501856763 \\n\\n Biofuels Int @biofuelsmag · \\n\\n27 Jan \\n\\n #Biofuels #producers across the United States are calling for greater #regulatory #clarity as the new 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit comes into force. \\nhttps://biofuels-news.com/news/biofuels-producers-seek-clarity-as-45z-clean-fuel-tax-credit-takes-effect/ \\nbiofuels bioethanol #farming #legislation #feedstock \\n\\n Reply on Twitter 2016119429961077013 Retweet on Twitter 2016119429961077013 Like on Twitter 2016119429961077013 1 Twitter 2016119429961077013 \\n\\nLoad More \\n\\n Published by Woodcote Media Ltd, Marshall House, 124 Middleton Road, Morden, Surrey.

Under 45Z, foreign used cooking oil (UCO) became ineligible for credits, while foreign tallow retained access until tariffs introduced in the third quarter disrupted trade. Starting in 2026, 45Z will apply exclusively to biofuels made from North American feedstocks, effectively excluding all other foreign products. \\n\\nPresident Donald Trump's administration's push to curb imports aims to strengthen domestic feedstocks, particularly soybean oil, in US biofuel production. US soybean crush capacity has grown by 13pc since 2022, reaching 2.97bn bushels (bu)/yr *w*ith the addition of 10 new crush plants. Expanded capacity drove a record 227.6mn bu of soybean crush in October, with multiple monthly records set throughout 2025.\\n\\nThe US biodiesel sector continues to rely on soybean oil as its primary feedstock, with soybean oil accounting for roughly 70pc of the biodiesel feedstock mix in 2024\\\\. Meanwhile, the renewable diesel (RD) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industries have increasingly targeted lower-carbon feedstocks to maximize credit value, resulting in soybean oil demand failing to meet the demand expectations of crushers.\\n\\nAgricultural lobbyists have long blamed foreign feedstocks for displacing domestic crop-based materials and have consistently pushed for restrictions. Heavy imports since early 2023 sidelined domestic supply, with Chinese UCO flooding the market and Brazilian and Australian tallow following suit. This surge drove record-high UCO consumption in July 2024, while tallow hit its own record in July 2025. \\n\\nFeedstock imports slowed in the second half of 2025 with new 45Z rules and import tariffs. Chinese UCO shipments in January-October 2025 fell by 65pc from a year earlier, while Brazilian tallow volumes plunged below 22mn lbs in the fourth quarter after 50pc tariffs were imposed in August, down from a record 154mn lbs in June. Australian tallow maintained strong flows until October despite 10pc tariffs, but volumes were expected to decline in late 2025 and beyond as 45Z restrictions take effect. \\n\\nIn June, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed record-high blending requirements for 2026 and 2027, alongside a measure to halve Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit generation for fuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. This proposal sparked a rally in domestic feedstock prices, with most categories hitting yearly highs in July. \\n\\nAgricultural lobbyists and waste-based feedstock suppliers support these RIN changes, viewing them as a boost for domestic feedstock demand. But optimism for domestic feedstocks is tempered by uncertainty surrounding the 45Z credit and delays in biofuel mandates, which are expected to extend into 2026.\\n\\nThe Trump administration confirmed in December that mandates would not be finalized before year-end, leaving market players without guidance about final mandatory volumes and potential import RIN credit cuts. Also in December, the US Department of the Treasury submitted a new 45Z proposal to the White House, as market participants seek updated guidance on filing tax credit claims for 2025, though officials will likely permit the use of existing guidance for 2025 claims. \\n\\nThis lack of clarity has triggered production cuts across multiple RD plants nationwide. Biofuel refiners such as Phillips 66 and Diamond Green Diesel have publicly announced rate reductions as renewable diesel margins dipped below 2024 levels. Some refiners continued tapping foreign feedstocks until December, avoiding some tariffs by claiming duty drawbacks and exporting the finished fuel abroad. Others remain cautious, as the half-RIN provision, if finalized, poses a significant risk to margins. \\n\\nLooking ahead, existing tariffs, new 45Z policies, record-high biofuel mandates, and the half-RIN provision are expected to support soybean oil demand in first-quarter 2026 as producers seek to maximize credits through domestic feedstock use. US soybean oil futures closed at 49.44¢/lb on 30 December, down by 14pc from their July peak of 57.54¢/lb, making soybean oil more attractive compared to waste-based feedstocks.\\n\\nAgriculture groups claim that expanded crush capacity and record production will provide sufficient soybean oil to meet biofuel demand, reducing reliance on imported feedstocks. In addition, the 45Z credit premium for soybean oil is expected to rise in 2026 as regulators stop considering potential land-use impacts of crop-based fuels, narrowing the gap with credit values for waste-based feedstocks. Soybean oil is also positioned to gain a competitive advantage over canola oil, which receives a roughly 50pc lower credit value.\\n\\nBy Jamuna Gautam\\n\\n---\\n\\nShare\\n\\n Related news posts\\n\\nArgus illuminates the markets by putting a lens on the areas that matter most to you.

SAF in India will be a controlled product, with prices set by the government based on the feedstock costs, Ballani said on the sidelines of the India Energy Week in Goa. He was unable to comment on when the roadmap will be published. Ballani also said that India aims to produce 4bn litres of SAF for international flights. India has targeted to blend 1pc SAF into jet fuel for international flights by 2027, rising to 2pc by 2028 and 5pc by 2030\\\\. Meanwhile, he noted that biodiesel production from used cooking oil (UCO) has not been viable because of feedstock aggregation issues, and current blending of biodiesel in diesel has been less than 1pc — far short of the country's 5pc blending target for 2030\\\\. Indian oil marketing companies are also working on blending ethanol into diesel, with trials in the preliminary stage, Ballani said. He added that India currently has the capacity to produce 32pc ethanol-blended gasoline and has reached its E20 target in 2025\\\\.

The decision to hold the rate, announced on Wednesday, follows a string of similar decisions since June 2025, when the central bank wrapped up a series of seven increases that raised the rate from a cyclical low of 10.5pc in September 2024, the central bank said. Domestically, economic activity appears to be moderating while the labor market is showing signs of resilience. Headline and underlying inflation measures continue to soften, but still remain above the inflation target. Brazil's headline inflation decelerated to an annual 4.26pc in December. Still, inflation expectations, as calculated by the bank's Focus survey, remain above target, at 4pc and 3.8pc for 2026 and 2027\\\\. The policy committee continues to monitor the impacts of the geopolitical context on Brazilian inflation, as well as how evolving fiscal policy impacts monetary policy and financial assets. Most financial market participants expected the central bank to hold at the first meeting of 2026 but project a 50 percentage point cut in March, bank BTG Pactual says.

All rights reserved.NewsBrazil to allow UCO imports for SAF production 28/01/26News28/01/26 Brazil to allow UCO imports for SAF productionSao Paulo, 28 January (Argus) — Brazil will allow used cooking oil (UCO) imports exclusively for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a government representative said on Wednesday. Brazil currently prohibits UCO imports under rules that also prohibit most solid waste, unlike other countries that consider them feedstocks for biofuels or power production. The government plans to authorize an import quota — yet to be specified — to support SAF production for a limited period, Euler Lage, a project manager focused on renewables for the presidential chief of staff, said during a webinar. But some Brazilian suppliers import UCO flagged as various fats to avoid the restriction, according to market sources. UCO and tallow are the main feedstocks used in the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids production route for SAF. Brazil is expected to focus on biomass-sourced and alcohol-to-jet routes to produce SAF, mostly because its second-harvest crops have lower carbon intensity compared with that from giant agricultural competitors like the US, speakers said at the webinar. Content platform Sustainable Aviation Futures Latin America — which is focused on accelerating the aviation industry's decarbonization — and national civil aviation agency Anac hosted the webinar on 28 January. Sustainable Aviation Futures will host a SAF-focused event on 2-4 March, in Sao Paulo, to discuss further regulations and regional development opportunities in the sector. Brazil expects to finish its SAF regulation by June 2026\\\\. Domestic production may reach approximately 661mn l (11,460 b/d) in 2027, then rise to 1.7bn l in 2030 and to 2.8bn l in 2033, according to energy research firm EPE estimates.

All rights reserved.NewsUS naphtha displaces Russian flows to Venezuela 28/01/26News28/01/26 US naphtha displaces Russian flows to VenezuelaNew York, 28 January (Argus) — Naphtha shipments to Venezuela loading in January have come entirely from US Gulf coast suppliers, reversing the previous Russia-dominated trade for the diluent needed to transport Venezuelan crude after US intervention. Ports in Houston, Beaumont and Corpus Christi, Texas, have shipped between 970,000-1.22mn bl of naphtha to Venezuela so far this month, according to Kpler and Vortexa data, compared to 560,000-1.21mn bl for the last three months of 2025, when Chevron was the only oil major with a US government waiver to trade with Venezuela. Vitol has joined commodity trader Trafigura in this naphtha trade, after the US physically removed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro from power and cracked down on sanctioned vessel shipments to and from the country, cutting the primarily Russian flow of the diluent to Venezuela. Since 2023 Venezuela has been the importer for the majority of Caribbean-bound naphtha, and was typically the second-largest buyer of US Gulf coast naphtha, before the US government removed sanctions waivers in May 2025\\\\. Buyers in the country primarily import naphtha on long range 1 (LR1) tankers, while the US Gulf coast spot market for refined product shipments is typically dominated by medium range (MR) tankers. Rising Venezuelan demand could spur additional LR1 demand from the US Gulf coast, which primarily trades as a backhaul for more liquid LR1 markets in deeper Pacific basin ports, especially for Mideast Gulf loadings. This could also affect the MR tanker market as other Caribbean naphtha buyers look to stock up ahead of further Venezuelan demand. Chevron sought an MR tanker for a US Gulf coast-Caribbean voyage on 27 January to load naphtha between 30 January and 1 February. A charterer later fixed at least one Caribbean-bound MR tanker at a $900,000 lumpsum on the same day, a 44pc jump in the voyage rate from the $625,000 lumpsum at the end of the trading day on 23 January. It is unclear if the second cargo was naphtha or another refined product. Naphtha spot participants unimpressed A swift rise in N+A naphtha prices on the US Gulf coast opened the arbitrage to the region, following the new supply agreement between the US and Venezuela. Differentials for heavy naphtha, the primary grade use as a Venezuelan diluent, shot up by more than 10¢/USG just before the first US naphtha shipment in early January. By mid-January, N+A naphtha differentials gave up all the gains. Selling interest for US Gulf coast naphtha diminished following the open arbitrage, potentially setting a precedent that sellers wanted to avoid in an already long market. A cargo of naphtha from Huelva, Spain, was booked for the US Gulf coast on 13 January with an estimated arrival of 3 February, shipping reports show. This supported the view that the naphtha arbitrage to the US Gulf coast was open. The Huelva cargo was reportedly suitable for blending to the Venezuelan diluent naphtha specification, but this was not confirmed. The Venezuelan diluent naphtha specification was roughly gauged as 70pc heavy naphtha and about 20-30pc lighter naphtha. Increased Venezuelan production in the longer run is not entirely bullish for US naphtha markets. Before Venezuelan production slowed during the regime of former president Hugo Chavez, Venezuela actively exported light naphtha from Jose and Las Salinas, primarily to the US Atlantic coast. Increased Venezuelan rates would also elevate naphtha production, which could diminish appetite for US naphtha imports and displace US naphtha market share globally.

All rights reserved.NewsTrump threatens 100pc tariff on Canada 24/01/26News24/01/26 Trump threatens 100pc tariff on CanadaWashington, 24 January (Argus) — President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose a 100pc tariff on imports from Canada if Ottawa concludes a trade deal with Beijing. The trade deal, announced during Canadian prime minister Mark Carney's meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping in Beijing on 16 January, involves China cutting combined tariffs on canola imports from Canada to 15pc by 1 March, and Canada allowing 49,000 electric vehicle imports a year from China at the most-favored-nation tariff of 6.1pc. Trump at the time said that \\\"it's a good thing for (Carney) to sign a trade deal,\\\" adding that \\\"if you can get a deal with China, you should do that.\\\" But Trump has changed his tune, writing on Saturday in a social media post, \\\"If Governor (sic) Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\\\" The White House has not released any executive order backing Trump's Canada tariff threat, nor did it immediately explain which Canada-China trade deal he referenced. Trump's latest tariff follows an exchange of barbs that began at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this week. In a 20 January address to the forum, Carney — without mentioning Trump by name — issued a rebuke of Trump's aggressive global trade and military policy. Carney called on European countries to join Canada in finding alternatives to economic, trade and political alliances centered around Washington. Trump, addressing Davos a day later, shot back at Carney. \\\"Canada lives because of the United States,\\\" Trump said. \\\"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\\\" Speaking during a visit to Qatar on Friday, Carney replied: \\\"Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.\\\" Trump is scheduled to visit Beijing in April for a meeting with Xi to discuss a possible US-China trade deal. US imports from Canada have been subject to a 35pc tariff since August, with separate duties on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum. In practice, imports from Canada are taxed at the lowest rates among the top US trading partners, because the bulk of trade is exempted from tariffs under the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. Energy commodities are also exempted from Trump's existing tariffs. Trump's ability to quickly levy tariffs on Canada and other trading partners is under review at the US Supreme Court, which is expected to issue a ruling soon. Trump's administration has not issued major tariff decisions in recent months, despite Trump's threats to do so. Trump earlier this month threatened to impose a 25pc tariff on US imports from countries doing business with Iran, but no decision has been made. Trump on 17 January threatened to impose a 10pc tariff on imports from the UK and seven EU members, which pushed back against his bid to annex Denmark's Greenland territory. Trump on 21 January withdrew that tariff threat after a slide in US stock and financial markets.
